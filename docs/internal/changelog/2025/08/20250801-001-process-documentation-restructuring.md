# Process Documentation Restructuring and Consolidation

## Context
Implemented a comprehensive restructuring of the development process documentation to establish structured iterative design workflows while eliminating documentation duplication and creating single sources of truth. This addresses the need for clearer separation between system-wide and per-increment activities, better template organization, and consolidated development standards.

## Changes Made

### Code Changes
- **docs/internal/process/development-process.md** - Complete restructuring to separate system-wide activities (Step 1) from per-increment activities (Steps 2-5), consolidated development validation into single comprehensive section, moved environment setup to development phase
- **docs/internal/design-principles.md** → **docs/internal/design-principles-and-standards.md** - Renamed and expanded to become single source of truth for all development standards, integrated Repository & Version Control standards, Testing standards, Code Review standards, Build & Deployment standards, Security & Compliance standards, Process & Infrastructure standards

### Documentation Changes

#### New Documents Created
- **docs/internal/templates/feature-decomposition-specification.md** - Comprehensive template for feature decomposition specification combining previous separate worksheet and increment definition templates
- **docs/internal/templates/implementation-learning-capture.md** - Template for capturing learnings from increment implementation in iterative approach
- **docs/internal/templates/technical-design-template.md** - Moved from specs directory, comprehensive technical design template
- **docs/internal/prompts/feature-decomposition-prompt.md** - AI agent prompt for conducting structured feature decomposition interviews
- **docs/internal/prompts/technical-design-prompt.md** - Unified AI agent prompt for conducting technical design interviews (handles both monolithic and iterative approaches)
- **docs/internal/prompts/requirements-gathering-prompt.md** - Moved from process directory

#### Document Moves and Reorganization
- **docs/internal/specs/requirements-template.md** → **docs/internal/templates/requirements-template.md** - Moved to consolidate all templates in single directory
- **docs/internal/process/requirements-gathering-prompt.md** → **docs/internal/prompts/requirements-gathering-prompt.md** - Moved to consolidate all prompts in single directory
- **docs/internal/specs/technical-design-template.md** → **docs/internal/templates/technical-design-template.md** - Moved to templates directory
- **docs/internal/process/feature-decomposition-prompt.md** → **docs/internal/prompts/feature-decomposition-prompt.md** - Moved to prompts directory

#### Documents Deleted/Merged
- **docs/internal/process/iterative-design-process.md** - DELETED: Content integrated into development-process.md for better workflow coherence
- **docs/internal/templates/increment-definition-template.md** - DELETED: Merged into feature-decomposition-specification.md
- **docs/internal/templates/feature-decomposition-worksheet.md** - DELETED: Merged into feature-decomposition-specification.md  
- **docs/internal/templates/increment-design-session-prompt.md** - DELETED: Merged into technical-design-prompt.md
- **docs/internal/process/design-gathering-prompt.md** - DELETED: Merged into technical-design-prompt.md
- **docs/internal/specs/performance-analysis-design.md** - DELETED: Premature design document removed in favor of structured interview approach

### Configuration Changes
- **docs/internal/process/development-process.md** - Updated version from 1.0 to 1.1, updated last modified date to 2025-07-31

## Testing Performed
- Verified all internal document links are working correctly after directory restructuring
- Confirmed all templates follow consistent format and reference patterns
- Validated that all prompts reference correct template paths
- Checked that development-process.md workflow phases are logically sequenced and complete
- Verified design-principles-and-standards.md contains comprehensive coverage of all development standards without duplication

## Impact Assessment

### Breaking Changes
- **Template and prompt file paths changed** - Any existing references to moved files will need to be updated
- **Workflow phase numbering changed** - Step numbering changed from mixed-scope 5 phases to clearly separated system-wide (Step 1) and per-increment (Steps 2-5) phases
- **Process document structure changed** - Sections in development-process.md significantly restructured with new organization

### Performance Impact
- **Improved workflow clarity** - Clear separation of system-wide vs per-increment activities eliminates confusion about when activities occur
- **Reduced documentation overhead** - Single source of truth for development standards eliminates maintenance of duplicate information
- **Better template organization** - Consolidated directories make templates and prompts easier to find and maintain

### Security Considerations
- No security implications - documentation-only changes

## Deployment Notes

### Prerequisites
- Update any bookmarks or references to moved template and prompt files
- Review any external documentation that references the old development process phase structure

### Rollback Plan
- Git history preserves all previous versions of modified files
- Deleted files can be restored from git history if needed
- Template and prompt directory changes can be reversed by moving files back to original locations

## Follow-up Actions

### Immediate
- Update any external references to moved template and prompt files
- Communicate new workflow structure to development team
- Update any tooling or scripts that reference old file paths

### Future
- Consider creating workflow automation tools that leverage the new structured approach
- Evaluate effectiveness of new process structure after 2-3 development cycles
- Consider adding visual workflow diagrams to complement the structured documentation

## Related Issues/PRs

### Issues Resolved
- Eliminated duplication of development standards across multiple documents
- Resolved confusion about when system-wide vs per-increment activities occur
- Consolidated scattered templates and prompts into organized directories

### Related Work
- Builds on previous requirements gathering process improvements
- Establishes foundation for structured iterative design implementation
- Supports future automation of development workflow processes

## Technical Details

### Architecture Changes
- Established clear separation of concerns between system-wide and per-increment documentation
- Created single source of truth architecture for development standards
- Implemented template inheritance pattern where development-process.md references detailed standards in design-principles-and-standards.md

### Implementation Notes
- New 5-phase workflow: (1) Feature Analysis & Design [system-wide], (2) Increment Design [per-increment], (3) Development [per-increment], (4) Review & Approval [per-increment], (5) Integration & Release [per-increment]
- All quality standards and checklists now reference design-principles-and-standards.md to eliminate duplication
- Templates and prompts organized into dedicated directories for better maintainability
- Unified technical design prompt handles both monolithic and iterative approaches to reduce process complexity
