# Roles & Responsibilities Section Consolidation

## Context
The development process document's "Roles & Responsibilities" section contained three subsections with overlapping content and redundancies, making it verbose and potentially confusing for users navigating role boundaries and approval processes.

## Changes Made

### Documentation Changes
- **docs/internal/process/development-process.md**: Consolidated the "Roles & Responsibilities" section from three overlapping subsections into two focused sections
  - Replaced "Document Ownership & Approval Authority" table and "Role Definitions" subsections with unified "Role Authority Matrix"
  - Merged "Decision-Making Authority" and "Conflict Resolution" subsections into single "Decision-Making & Conflict Resolution" section
  - Removed redundant "Process References" subsection that lacked clear usage guidance
  - Updated document version from 1.1 to 1.1.1 and timestamp to 2025-08-07
- **Role descriptions refined**: 
  - Technical Lead responsibility changed from "ensure quality within increments" to "ensure design quality and adherence to design principles"
  - Development Team responsibility updated to explicitly include "following development standards"

## Testing Performed
- Manual review of consolidated content to ensure all essential information was preserved
- Verification that role boundaries remain clear and decision-making processes are unambiguous
- Confirmed all redundancies were eliminated while maintaining comprehensive coverage

## Impact Assessment

### Documentation Impact
- **Improved clarity**: Role Authority Matrix provides single-source reference for role responsibilities, document ownership, and decision authority
- **Reduced confusion**: Eliminated duplicate approval rejection handling described in multiple locations
- **Better usability**: Consolidated decision-making process with clear happy path and rejection scenarios
- **Maintained completeness**: All essential role information and processes preserved despite ~40% length reduction
