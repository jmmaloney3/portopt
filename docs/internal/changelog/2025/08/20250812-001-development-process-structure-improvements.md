# Development Process Structure & Consistency Improvements

## Context
The development process document needed structural improvements to achieve consistency across all sections and better organization of related information, specifically addressing inconsistent section structures, mixed terminology, and scattered standards.

## Changes Made

### Documentation Changes
- **docs/internal/process/development-process.md**: Major structural improvements for consistency and clarity
  - **Universal Section Structure**: Standardized all 16 numbered sections to follow consistent "What to do" + "Instructions" + "Completion Criteria" pattern
  - **Document Creation Alignment**: Added review and iteration steps to sections 1.3 (Feature Decomposition) and 2.2 (Technical Design) to match the structured approach used in section 1.1 (Requirements)
  - **Terminology Standardization**: Changed all "Deliverables" and "[Topic] Checklist" sections to consistent "Completion Criteria" terminology across all sections
  - **Content Consolidation**: Removed redundant "Design-Time Discovery Process" and "Implementation-Time Discovery Process" sections since these are handled in the unified "Decision-Making & Conflict Resolution" section
  - **Missing Elements Added**: Added "Completion Criteria" section to 4.2 and "Instructions" headers to sections missing them
  - **Standards Reference Improvement**: Enhanced "Reference Materials" section with better organization of development standards
  - **Related Documents Enhancement**: Added missing template links (Feature Decomposition Specification, Technical Design Template, Implementation Learning Capture, Changelog Template)
  - **Version Update**: Incremented from 1.1.1 to 1.1.2
  - **Whitespace Cleanup**: Removed all trailing whitespace throughout the document

- **docs/internal/design-principles-and-standards.md**: Enhanced code review standards
  - **Code Review Standards Expansion**: Added "Code Review Focus Areas" and "Code Review Feedback Guidelines" sections moved from the process document to centralize all code review standards
  - **Better Integration**: Process document now references these standards sections rather than duplicating content

## Testing Performed
- Manual review of all 16 numbered sections to verify consistent structure implementation
- Verification that all document creation steps (1.1, 1.3, 2.2) now follow the same review-and-iterate pattern
- Confirmation that terminology is consistent across all completion criteria sections
- Validation that code review standards are properly centralized and referenced

## Impact Assessment

### Process Improvements
- **Structural Consistency**: All process steps now follow predictable patterns, reducing cognitive load for users
- **Better Quality Gates**: Document creation steps now include proper stakeholder validation (Requirements → Product Manager, Feature Decomposition → Technical Leads, Technical Design → Implementation Teams)
- **Clearer Terminology**: "Completion Criteria" clearly communicates purpose vs ambiguous "Deliverables"
- **Reduced Redundancy**: Eliminated duplicate content between sections and documents
- **Improved Maintainability**: Centralized standards make updates easier and more consistent
- **Enhanced Usability**: Complete template links enable easier navigation to supporting materials

### Documentation Quality
- **Single Source of Truth**: Code review standards consolidated in design-principles document
- **Complete Reference**: All templates and prompts now linked in Related Documents section
- **Clean Formatting**: Trailing whitespace removed improves git diff readability
