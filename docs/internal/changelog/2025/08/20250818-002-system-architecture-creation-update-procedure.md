# System Architecture Creation/Update Procedure Implementation

## Context
The development process needed to handle both bootstrapping scenarios (creating new system architecture documents) and maintenance scenarios (updating existing documents). The existing process assumed an architecture document already existed, which didn't support new projects or re-engineering scenarios like the portopt project.

## Changes Made

### Documentation Changes
- **Updated development process** (`docs/internal/process/development-process.md`):
  - Modified Step 1.2 to handle both creation and update scenarios
  - Added conditional logic to skip architecture analysis when document doesn't exist
  - Added template reference for creating new architecture documents
  - Simplified approach to treat document creation as infrequent special case

- **Enhanced system architecture update prompt** (`docs/internal/prompts/system-architecture-update-prompt.md`):
  - Added Phase 0: Scenario Assessment to determine appropriate workflow
  - Made phases conditional based on scenario (existing doc, codebase, new features)
  - Added support for four scenarios: update existing, create from existing codebase, create from scratch, re-engineering
  - Added architecture document validation to detect drift between documentation and implementation
  - Enhanced document creation/update process to handle both new and existing documents
  - Added architectural drift detection and handling

- **Created system architecture template** (`docs/internal/templates/system-architecture-template.md`):
  - Streamlined template removing redundancies with design principles document
  - Consolidated related information into single sections
  - Added section descriptions to guide users on content expectations
  - Made template reusable across multiple projects

## Testing Performed
- **Template validation**: Verified system architecture template structure and completeness
- **Process flow validation**: Confirmed development process handles both creation and update scenarios
- **Prompt validation**: Tested scenario assessment logic and conditional phase execution
- **Cross-reference validation**: Ensured all document references are consistent and accurate

## Impact Assessment

### Breaking Changes
- None - all changes are additive and backward compatible

### Performance Impact
- Improved efficiency for new project bootstrapping
- Reduced complexity in architecture documentation process

## Follow-up Actions

### Immediate
- Test the new procedure with the portopt project re-engineering scenario
- Validate that the scenario assessment correctly identifies and handles the portopt use case

### Future
- Consider creating a dedicated "architecture re-engineering" prompt for pure documentation scenarios
- Monitor usage patterns to identify potential improvements to the scenario assessment logic

## Related Issues/PRs

### Issues Resolved
- Development process now supports new project bootstrapping
- Architecture documentation can be created from existing codebases
- Handles realistic scenario of code changes without documentation updates

## Technical Details

### Architecture Changes
- **Process Architecture**: Enhanced development process to handle multiple architecture scenarios
- **Documentation Architecture**: Implemented conditional workflow based on project state
- **Template Architecture**: Created reusable template with clear section guidance

### Implementation Notes
- **Lightweight Approach**: Chose simple conditional logic over complex branching to maintain process simplicity
- **Scenario Handling**: Implemented four distinct scenarios with appropriate workflow selection
- **Drift Detection**: Added validation to identify and address architectural drift between documentation and implementation
- **Template Design**: Focused on eliminating redundancies and consolidating related information while maintaining comprehensive coverage
