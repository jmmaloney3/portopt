# Requirements Template Improvements: Add Personas, Remove DX Requirements, Clean Formatting

## Context
The requirements template needed to be updated to support both developer-facing libraries and end-user facing applications. The original template was focused specifically on `portopt` and included DX requirements that were determined to be better handled in design documents. The template was expanded to include personas for better user-centered design, then simplified by removing DX requirements to create a cleaner, more focused template.

## Changes Made

### Documentation Changes
- **Updated `docs/internal/templates/requirements-template.md`**: Replaced original template with expanded version that includes personas and removes DX requirements
- **Removed `docs/internal/templates/requirements-template-expanded.md`**: Consolidated to single template file
- **Added comprehensive personas section**: Includes primary personas, secondary personas, and anti-personas with detailed templates and examples for both library and application contexts
- **Removed DX requirements section**: Eliminated entire Developer Experience requirements framework to simplify template
- **Updated traceability framework**: Modified all traceability sections to include persona references and remove DX requirements
- **Generalized template scope**: Updated language to work for both developer-facing libraries and end-user facing applications
- **Cleaned whitespace**: Removed all trailing whitespace from the template file

## Testing Performed
- **Template validation**: Verified all sections are properly structured and complete
- **Whitespace cleanup verification**: Confirmed no trailing whitespace issues remain using `git diff --check`
- **Git status verification**: Confirmed changes are properly tracked and ready for commit
- **Cross-references validation**: Checked that all internal links and references are consistent

## Impact Assessment

### Breaking Changes
- **DX requirements removed**: Projects that were using the DX requirements section will need to document those requirements elsewhere (e.g., in design documents or API guidelines)
- **Template structure change**: Requirements flow now starts with Personas instead of Business Requirements

### Performance Impact
- **Template usability**: Simplified structure reduces cognitive load and makes template easier to use
- **Maintenance**: Single template reduces maintenance overhead compared to maintaining separate expanded version

## Deployment Notes

### Prerequisites
- None - template changes are self-contained

### Rollback Plan
- Can restore original template from git history if needed
- DX requirements can be re-added if real experience shows they're needed

## Follow-up Actions

### Immediate
- Commit the template changes
- Update any existing requirements documents that reference the old template structure

### Future
- Monitor usage to determine if DX requirements need to be added back based on real project experience
- Consider creating library-specific supplement if needed for detailed DX guidance

## Related Issues/PRs

### Issues Resolved
- Template scope limitation to developer-facing libraries only
- Over-complexity of DX requirements in main requirements document
- Lack of user-centered design foundation in requirements process

## Technical Details

### Architecture Changes
- **Requirements hierarchy**: Changed from 7 requirement types to 5 (removed DX and UX requirements)
- **User foundation**: Added personas as the foundational layer in requirements flow
- **Generalization**: Made template applicable to multiple project types instead of library-specific

### Implementation Notes
- **Template consolidation**: Used git-aware file replacement to maintain version control history
- **Whitespace cleanup**: Used `sed` command to remove trailing whitespace from all lines
- **Traceability updates**: Systematically updated all traceability sections to reflect new structure
- **Example preservation**: Kept relevant examples while generalizing language for broader applicability
