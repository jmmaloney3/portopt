# System Architecture Update Prompt Improvements

## Context
The system architecture update prompt needed simplification and better support for all scenarios. The original Quick Start section assumed both requirements and architecture documents always existed, but the scenarios showed this wasn't always the case. Additionally, Scenario B (create architecture from existing codebase + new features) was complex and recommended splitting into two steps.

## Changes Made

### Documentation Changes
- **Simplified Quick Start section**: Replaced three separate scenario-specific prompts with one generic prompt that supports all scenarios through optional inputs
- **Eliminated Scenario B**: Removed the complex "create architecture from existing codebase + new features" scenario to force the recommended two-step approach
- **Re-lettered scenarios**: Changed from A, C, D to consecutive A, B, C for better clarity
- **Added input options guidance**: Clear instructions on how to set each input to `None` when not applicable
- **Enhanced verification step**: AI now repeats back provided information for error prevention and clarity
- **Updated scenario determination**: Removed Scenario B references and updated workflow selection
- **Improved two-step approach guidance**: Clearer instructions for users with both existing codebase and new features

## Testing Performed
- **Manual review**: Verified all scenario combinations work correctly with the simplified prompt
- **Consistency check**: Ensured scenario letters and references are consistent throughout the document
- **Clarity validation**: Confirmed the simplified approach is easier to understand and use

## Impact Assessment

### Breaking Changes
- **Scenario B removed**: Users who previously used Scenario B must now use the two-step approach (Scenario B then Scenario A)
- **Scenario lettering changed**: Previous Scenario C is now Scenario B, previous Scenario D is now Scenario C

## Follow-up Actions

### Immediate
- Update any existing documentation that references the old scenario letters
- Consider updating related prompts or templates that may reference the old scenario structure

### Future
- Monitor usage patterns to ensure the simplified approach is working effectively
- Consider creating quick reference cards for the different scenario configurations

## Technical Details

### Architecture Changes
- **Simplified user interface**: Reduced cognitive load by providing one flexible prompt instead of three specific ones
- **Forced best practices**: Eliminated complex scenario to encourage proper two-step architecture development
- **Enhanced error prevention**: Added verification step to catch misunderstandings early

### Implementation Notes
- The generic prompt approach maintains all functionality while being much more user-friendly
- The verification step helps prevent wasted time due to incorrect information
- The two-step approach recommendation is now enforced rather than just suggested
