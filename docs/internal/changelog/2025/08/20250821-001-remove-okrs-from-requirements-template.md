# Remove OKRs from Requirements Template: Align with Standard Requirements Engineering Practices

## Context
After removing DX requirements from the requirements template in a previous session, we identified that OKRs (Objectives & Key Results) are fundamentally planning objectives rather than requirements. OKRs belong in project planning and management documents, not in requirements specifications, as they define how ambitiously to deliver requirements rather than what requirements should be built.

## Changes Made

### Documentation Changes
- **Updated `docs/internal/templates/requirements-template.md`**: Removed entire OKRs section and all related references
- **Simplified requirements structure**: Changed from 5 requirement types to 4 (removed OKRs)
- **Updated traceability framework**: Removed all OBJ-ID references and updated traceability chains
- **Cleaned up business requirements section**: Removed references to strategic goals and measurable outcomes
- **Updated validation guidance**: Removed OKR-related validation items from traceability checklist

## Testing Performed
- **Template validation**: Verified all sections are properly structured and complete after OKR removal
- **Whitespace cleanup verification**: Confirmed no trailing whitespace issues using `git diff --check`
- **Cross-references validation**: Checked that all internal links and references are consistent
- **Traceability validation**: Ensured traceability flow works correctly: Persona → Problem Statement → User Story → Functional Requirements

## Impact Assessment

### Breaking Changes
- **OKRs removed**: Projects using the template will no longer have OKR guidance in requirements documents
- **Traceability structure change**: Requirements now flow directly from Problem Statements to User Stories without OKR layer
- **Template structure change**: Requirements overview now describes 4 types instead of 5

### Performance Impact
- **Template usability**: Simplified structure reduces cognitive load and aligns with standard requirements engineering practices
- **Maintenance**: Cleaner template reduces maintenance overhead and confusion about requirements vs planning

## Deployment Notes

### Prerequisites
- None - template changes are self-contained

### Rollback Plan
- Can restore original template with OKRs from git history if needed
- OKRs can be re-added if real experience shows they're needed in requirements documents

## Follow-up Actions

### Immediate
- Update any existing requirements documents that reference the old template structure
- Consider creating separate project planning template for OKRs if needed

### Future
- Monitor usage to determine if separate OKR guidance is needed for project planning
- Consider creating project planning template that includes OKRs, timelines, and success metrics

## Related Issues/PRs

### Issues Resolved
- Misalignment between requirements engineering standards and template structure
- Confusion between requirements (WHAT) and planning objectives (HOW WELL/WHEN)
- Template scope creep into project management territory

## Technical Details

### Architecture Changes
- **Requirements hierarchy**: Changed from 5 requirement types to 4 (removed OKRs)
- **Traceability flow**: Simplified from Persona → Problem → Objective → User Story → Functional Requirements to Persona → Problem → User Story → Functional Requirements
- **Template focus**: Now purely focused on requirements engineering rather than mixing requirements and planning

### Implementation Notes
- **Systematic removal**: Used search and replace to remove all OKR references consistently
- **Traceability updates**: Updated all traceability sections to remove OBJ-ID references
- **Validation updates**: Modified traceability validation checklist to reflect new structure
- **Example preservation**: Kept relevant examples while removing OKR-specific content
