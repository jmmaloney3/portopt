# System Architecture Template Improvements

## Context
The system architecture template had several issues that needed resolution: contradictory language about implementation details vs implementation specifics, redundant information between component-level and system-level sections, and process information that belonged in the development process document rather than the template.

## Changes Made

### Documentation Changes
- **Fixed contradictory language** in Component Architecture section - changed "implementation details" to "architectural decisions" and clarified the distinction between high-level design choices and low-level implementation specifics
- **Eliminated redundancy** between component-level and system-level technology/data documentation by implementing reference-based approach where component sections list technologies/data structures and reference detailed sections for specifications
- **Removed redundant process information** - deleted entire "Document Maintenance" section as this information is already covered in the development process document
- **Updated section descriptions** to clarify single source of truth approach for Technology Architecture and Data Architecture sections

## Testing Performed
- **Template validation** - Verified template structure remains coherent and all sections flow logically
- **Cross-reference validation** - Confirmed that component sections properly reference system-level sections without creating circular dependencies
- **Process alignment** - Verified that removed process information is adequately covered in development process document

## Impact Assessment

### Breaking Changes
- **Template structure changes** - Existing system architecture documents using the old template structure will need to be updated to follow new reference-based approach
- **Section naming changes** - "Implementation Details" subsection renamed to "Architectural Decisions" in component descriptions

## Follow-up Actions

### Immediate
- Update any existing system architecture documents to follow new template structure
- Review other templates for similar redundancy issues

### Future
- Consider applying similar reference-based approach to other templates to reduce redundancy
- Monitor template usage to ensure reference-based approach is working effectively

## Technical Details

### Architecture Changes
- **Template design philosophy** - Moved from redundant documentation to single source of truth with references
- **Process separation** - Clarified boundary between template content and process governance

### Implementation Notes
- **Reference-based documentation** - Component sections now list technologies/data structures and reference detailed sections rather than duplicating information
- **Process consolidation** - All process governance information consolidated in development process document
- **Language clarity** - Resolved contradiction between "implementation details" and "implementation specifics" by using "architectural decisions" terminology
