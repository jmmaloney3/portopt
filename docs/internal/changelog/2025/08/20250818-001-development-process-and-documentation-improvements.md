# Development Process and Feature Decomposition Improvements

## Context
The development process needed significant improvements to better support single developer + AI agent teams and address structural issues in the feature decomposition phase. The existing process had gaps in system architecture integration, unclear separation of concerns between system-level and feature-level design, and a feature decomposition template that was overly complex with redundant sections and unclear organization.

## Changes Made

### Development Process Changes
- **Restructured Step 1.2**: Renamed from "Determine Design Approach" to "System Architecture Integration" and focused on updating living system architecture
- **Restructured Step 1.3**: Renamed from "Plan Feature Decomposition" to "Feature Decomposition Planning" and focused on breaking down features into increments
- **Removed artificial distinction**: Eliminated the "Determine Design Approach" step that incorrectly assumed system-level design was only needed for iterative approaches
- **Added decision-making references**: Integrated references to Decision-Making & Conflict Resolution process into stakeholder review instructions
- **Updated role authority matrix**: Updated Architecture Lead and Technical Lead responsibilities to reflect new document ownership
- **Consolidated process principles**: Merged "Incremental Delivery" and "Early Delivery Philosophy" sections into single "Incremental Delivery Philosophy"

### New Documentation Created
- **System Architecture Document**: Created living system architecture document template for capturing system design and feature integration decisions
- **System Architecture Update Prompt**: Created AI agent prompt for conducting structured system architecture update interviews
- **Enhanced Feature Decomposition Prompt**: Updated to include system integration analysis aspects and align with new process

### Documentation Changes
- **Simplified increment description structure**: Consolidated fragmented information into logical sections with clear guidance text
- **Restructured summary sections**: Eliminated redundant top-level sections and consolidated into streamlined summary tables
- **Removed project management overhead**: Eliminated duration, timeline, risk assessment, and effort estimation sections
- **Improved section organization**: Moved architecture integration into individual increment descriptions and reordered sections for better flow
- **Added clear guidance text**: Each section now includes explanatory text about its purpose and content expectations

### Key Structural Changes
- **Consolidated increment information**: Moved all increment-specific details (rework, learning, design planning) into main increment definitions
- **Simplified summary table**: Created single "Increment Overview & Dependency Matrix" with columns for User Value & Key Capabilities, Requires, Provides, and Sequencing Rationale
- **Reorganized increment sections**: New structure includes User Value & Key Capabilities, Design, Technical Implementation, Learning Opportunities, and Increment Relationships
- **Moved decomposition rationale**: Relocated from requirements summary to feature decomposition overview section
- **Eliminated redundant sections**: Removed Major Functional Areas, System Architecture Overview, Dependency Analysis, Implementation Sequence & Rationale, and Resource and Timeline Considerations
- **Removed deleted files**: Eliminated system-integration-template.md and system-integration-prompt.md as redundant with new approach

### Template Improvements
- **Added section guidance**: Each increment section includes explanatory text about purpose and content expectations
- **Improved traceability**: Key Capabilities section now references specific requirements (FR-1, FR-2, etc.)
- **Better organization**: Architecture Integration moved to Technical Implementation section where it logically belongs
- **Simplified for small teams**: Removed timeline/duration tracking and risk assessment sections
- **Enhanced readability**: Consolidated overlapping sections and eliminated redundancy

## Testing Performed
- **Process validation**: Verified development process steps are logical and complete
- **Template validation**: Verified all sections are properly structured and guidance text is clear
- **Consistency check**: Ensured increment descriptions align with summary table structure
- **Usability review**: Confirmed template is appropriate for single developer + AI agent context
- **Documentation flow**: Validated logical progression from overview to detailed descriptions
- **Prompt validation**: Verified AI agent prompts align with updated process and templates

## Impact Assessment

### Breaking Changes
- **Process structure changes**: Development process steps have been reorganized and renamed
- **Template structure changes**: Existing feature decomposition documents using the old template will need to be restructured
- **Section reorganization**: Information previously in separate sections is now consolidated into increment descriptions
- **Document ownership changes**: Role authority matrix updated with new document responsibilities

### Documentation Impact
- **Improved usability**: Template is now more focused and easier to use for small teams
- **Better guidance**: Clear section descriptions help users understand what information belongs where
- **Reduced complexity**: Eliminated redundant sections and simplified structure
- **Enhanced process clarity**: Clear separation between system architecture and feature decomposition activities
- **Better AI integration**: Structured prompts enable effective AI agent collaboration

## Follow-up Actions

### Immediate
- Update any existing feature decomposition documents to use new template structure
- Review feature decomposition prompt to ensure alignment with new template
- Update any existing system architecture documentation to use new template
- Review development process with team to ensure understanding of new structure

### Future
- Consider creating example feature decomposition document using new template
- Evaluate if additional guidance is needed for complex multi-increment decompositions
- Consider creating example system architecture document using new template
- Evaluate effectiveness of new process structure for different project types

## Technical Details

### Process Structure Changes
- **Before**: Unclear separation between system architecture and feature decomposition, artificial distinction between monolithic and iterative approaches
- **After**: Clear separation with dedicated system architecture integration step and unified feature decomposition approach
- **Key improvement**: System architecture is now a living document maintained by Architecture Lead

### Template Structure Changes
- **Before**: Fragmented sections with information scattered across multiple areas
- **After**: Consolidated structure with clear separation between overview and detailed descriptions
- **Key improvement**: Single comprehensive table provides all essential planning information at a glance

### Design Decisions
- **Simplification philosophy**: Focused on essential information needed for planning and implementation
- **Small team optimization**: Removed project management overhead not needed for single developer + AI agent teams
- **Logical organization**: Information flows from high-level overview to detailed increment descriptions
- **Traceability maintenance**: Preserved links to requirements document while simplifying structure
- **Living architecture**: System architecture document evolves with each feature to maintain current state
- **AI integration**: Structured prompts enable effective collaboration between humans and AI agents
