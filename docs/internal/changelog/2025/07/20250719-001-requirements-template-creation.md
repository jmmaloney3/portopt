# Requirements Template and Development Process Creation

## Context
Created comprehensive requirements specification template and development process documentation for the portopt project. These new documents establish standardized approaches for capturing requirements and development practices for this developer-facing Python library.

Note: The development process documentation has not been reviewed.

## Changes Made

### New Documentation Created
- **docs/internal/specs/requirements-template.md**: New comprehensive requirements specification template for library projects
- **docs/internal/development-process.md**: New development process document with standards, policies, and quality gates (NEEDS TO BE REVIEWED)

### Requirements Template Structure

#### Requirements Overview Section
- Clear explanation of five requirement types (Business, Functional, DX, Non-Functional, Technical Constraints)
- WHY/WHAT/HOW/HOW WELL/WITHIN WHAT LIMITS framework
- Visual requirements flow diagram
- Library-specific guidance for developer-facing products

#### Business Requirements Section
- Problem Statements with comprehensive template and examples
- Objectives & Key Results with clear traceability guidance
- User Stories with both bullet-point and Given/When/Then acceptance criteria formats

#### Functional Requirements Section
- System capability templates and examples using blockquote formatting
- Focus on system capabilities independent of developer interaction
- Clear completion criteria and traceability guidance

#### Developer Experience (DX) Requirements Section
- **Expected Module Integration**: Where developers find functionality
- **API Design Considerations**: How functionality integrates with existing APIs
- **Error Handling & Developer Messaging**: How system communicates with developers
- **Documentation Requirements**: What documentation is needed for adoption
- **Learning Curve & Usability**: Developer onboarding and complexity expectations

#### Non-Functional Requirements Section
- Performance, Reliability, and Security requirements
- Clear separation from development process standards
- Focus on system quality attributes

#### Technical Constraints Section
- Clear guidance on constraints vs. design decisions
- Platform Requirements and Dependency Constraints structure
- Practical examples with library-specific context
- Reference to API Compatibility Policy in development process

### Development Process Document Structure
- **Definition of Done** with process requirements and quality gates
- **Development workflow** (Planning → Development → Review → Integration)
- **Code quality standards** specific to Python and portopt
- **API Compatibility Policy** with semantic versioning and deprecation process
- **Testing strategy** and **release process** guidance
- **Repository standards** and **CI/CD** requirements
- **Training and onboarding** procedures

## Testing Performed
- Reviewed entire document for consistency and completeness
- Verified all internal links work correctly
- Confirmed blockquote formatting renders properly
- Validated traceability matrix examples
- Ensured all sections follow consistent structure

## Impact Assessment

### New Capabilities
- **Standardized requirements process**: Consistent approach for capturing all types of requirements
- **Library-specific guidance**: Tailored templates for developer-facing products like portopt
- **Clear separation of concerns**: Distinct documents for requirements vs. development process
- **Developer experience focus**: First-class treatment of DX requirements for library projects
- **Comprehensive development standards**: Complete process documentation from code quality to release management

### Project Benefits
- **Improved requirement quality**: Structured templates with examples and guidance
- **Better traceability**: Clear relationships between business needs and system requirements
- **Consistent development practices**: Standardized Definition of Done and quality gates
- **API compatibility governance**: Clear policies for backwards compatibility and deprecation

## Follow-up Actions

### Immediate
- Update the placeholder date, session ID, and time in this changelog entry
- Review development-process.md for any project-specific tool/platform details to fill in

### Future
- Create example requirements documents using the new template
- Consider creating abbreviated templates for smaller features
- Gather feedback from requirements authors using the template

## Related Issues/PRs

### Capabilities Added
- Established clear framework for requirements, design, and development process documentation
- Created comprehensive guidance for all requirement types (Business, Functional, DX, Non-Functional, Technical Constraints)
- Defined developer experience as first-class concern for library products with dedicated templates and examples

## Technical Details

### Documentation Architecture
- **Document separation**: requirements-template.md (WHAT to build) vs. development-process.md (HOW to build)
- **Requirements hierarchy**: Business → Functional → DX → Non-Functional, all constrained by Technical Constraints
- **Library-specific focus**: Templates and examples tailored for developer-facing Python libraries

### Design Decisions
- **Blockquote formatting**: Used blockquotes for all templates/examples to enable proper markdown rendering
- **Flexible traceability**: Structured to support flexible relationships between Functional and DX requirements
- **Integration**: Incorporated existing portopt design principles and project-specific guidance
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Five requirement types cover complete spectrum from business need to system constraints
