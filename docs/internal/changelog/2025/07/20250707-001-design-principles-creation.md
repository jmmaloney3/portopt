# Design Principles Document Creation

## Context
Created a comprehensive design principles document for the portopt library to establish consistent development standards, API design guidelines, and architectural patterns. This was needed to provide clear guidance for both human developers and AI agents collaborating on the project, ensuring consistency across all modules and future development.

## Changes Made

### Documentation Changes
- **Created** `docs/internal/design-principles.md` - Comprehensive 300+ line document establishing project-wide design principles
- **Updated** requirements template to reference the new design principles document instead of duplicating API design principles in each requirements specification

### Code Changes
- **Organized** design principles into logical sections from high-level philosophy to implementation details
- **Eliminated** redundancy by removing duplicate API design principles from requirements template
- **Integrated** scikit-learn design principles adapted for portfolio optimization domain

## Testing Performed
- **Manual Review**: Thoroughly reviewed document structure and content for logical flow and completeness
- **Cross-Reference Check**: Verified that requirements template properly references the design principles document
- **Content Validation**: Ensured all important principles from previous discussions were preserved and organized

## Impact Assessment

### Breaking Changes
- None - This is a new documentation file that establishes standards without changing existing code

### Performance Impact
- No direct performance impact - documentation only

## Technical Details

### Architecture Changes
- **Established Four Core Principles**: Consistency, Inspection, Non-proliferation of Classes, and Composition (adapted from scikit-learn)
- **Defined Mixin Pattern Guidelines**: Comprehensive guidance for using mixins to create focused, testable, and composable functionality
- **Organized Principles Hierarchy**: From core philosophy → API design → architectural patterns → implementation standards

### Implementation Notes
- **Scikit-learn Adaptation**: Translated scikit-learn's machine learning principles to portfolio optimization context
- **Mixin Pattern Integration**: Added extensive guidance on mixin design principles with practical examples
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Includes code quality, testing, documentation, error handling, performance, and backward compatibility guidelines

### Key Sections Created
1. **Core Philosophy**: Establishes the library's foundational principles and relationship to the broader Python ecosystem
2. **API Design Principles**: Four core principles with practical implementation guidance
3. **Architectural Patterns**: Detailed mixin pattern guidelines with code examples
4. **Implementation Standards**: Code quality, testing, documentation, and module organization
5. **Data Handling Standards**: Data types, validation, and performance considerations
6. **Error Handling & Reliability**: Exception types, error messages, and reliability practices
7. **Configuration & Compatibility**: Configuration management and backward compatibility
8. **Performance Guidelines**: Optimization priorities and resource management
9. **Contributing Guidelines**: Code review and pull request requirements

### Document Structure Benefits
- **Eliminates Redundancy**: Single source of truth for design principles
- **Improves Maintainability**: Centralized location for updating standards
- **Enhances Onboarding**: New contributors have clear guidance
- **Supports AI Collaboration**: Provides context for AI agents working on the project
