# Performance Analysis Requirements Document Review and Enhancement

## Context
Enhanced the performance analysis requirements specification to address comprehensive factor analysis needs, specifically capturing both factor attribution and risk management scenarios for ticker-to-factor exposure analysis.

## Changes Made

### Documentation Changes
- Updated `docs/internal/specs/performance-analysis.md` - Enhanced factor analysis requirements to capture bidirectional analysis needs
- **Problem Statement PS-2**: Expanded to explicitly capture both factor→performance attribution AND ticker→factor exposure analysis for risk management
- **Functional Requirements FR-5**: Enhanced to include comprehensive factor attribution for both performance and risk management use cases
- **Functional Requirements FR-7**: Significantly expanded to address concentration risk, unintended exposure detection, and factor overlap analysis

### Requirements Specification Updates

#### Problem Statement Enhancements
- **PS-2 Enhanced**: Changed from "factor-level attribution capabilities" to "comprehensive factor analysis capabilities"
- **Added Bidirectional Analysis**: Now explicitly covers (1) factor contribution to performance and (2) ticker contribution to factor exposure
- **Risk Management Focus**: Added emphasis on managing factor concentration risk and identifying unintended exposures

#### Functional Requirements Enhancements
- **FR-5 Enhanced**: Added comprehensive factor attribution analysis covering both performance attribution and risk management
  - Added ticker→factor exposure contribution analysis
  - Enhanced results format to include "Ticker Y contributes 15% of Factor X exposure"
  - Added support for portfolio, account, and individual ticker level analysis
- **FR-7 Significantly Expanded**: Added detailed risk management capabilities
  - **Concentration Risk Analysis**: Holdings with highest factor contributions and configurable threshold warnings
  - **Unintended Exposure Detection**: Identifies unexpected factor exposures (e.g., emerging market exposure in "US equity" holdings)
  - **Factor Overlap Analysis**: Identifies redundant factor exposure through multiple holdings
  - **Ticker-to-Factor Mapping**: Shows percentage contributions of tickers to factor exposures
  - **Cross-Account Analysis**: Analysis at both account and portfolio levels
  - **Actionable Results**: Specific recommendations for addressing concentration risks

#### Asset Grouping Enhancements
- **FR-1, FR-3, FR-4, FR-5 Enhanced**: Added comprehensive **Flexible Asset Grouping** capabilities for all performance metrics
  - **Entire portfolio**: Complete portfolio-level performance analysis
  - **Account-level**: One or more accounts
  - **Ticker-level**: One or more tickers  
  - **Factor-level**: One or more factors
  - **Consistent across all metrics**: TWR, MWR, risk metrics, and factor attribution all support same grouping options
  - **Simplified language**: Changed from separate "single/subset" criteria to cleaner "one or more" language

#### User Story Enhancements
- **US-1, US-2, US-3, US-4, US-5 Enhanced**: Updated acceptance criteria to include detailed **Flexible Asset Grouping** specifications
  - **Consistent grouping language**: All user stories now use same "one or more" terminology for accounts, tickers, and factors
  - **Complete coverage**: User story acceptance criteria now match detailed functional requirements specifications
  - **Clear expectations**: Each user story explicitly defines supported asset grouping capabilities

#### Technical Constraints Updates
- **Dependency Constraints Corrected**: Updated existing portopt dependencies list to accurately reflect current dependencies
  - **Added**: cvxpy, statsmodel, bt, pyyaml, ibis-framework (corrected from "ibis")
  - **Clarified bt integration**: Noted that bt framework is already in use (not new dependency for performance analysis)
  - **Maintained**: pandas, numpy, duckdb, yfinance compatibility requirements

#### Requirements Document Finalization
- **Status Updated**: Changed requirements document status from "Draft" to "Approved"
  - **Last Updated Date**: Updated to 2025-07-27 to reflect review completion
  - **Ready for Implementation**: Requirements document now approved and ready to support implementation planning and development phases
  - **Requirements Review Complete**: Comprehensive review process completed with all identified enhancements incorporated

#### Traceability Updates
- Updated all traceability references to reflect enhanced problem statement PS-2
- Enhanced user story connections to include both US-4 (factor attribution) and US-5 (holdings driving factor exposure) for FR-5

## Testing Performed
- Reviewed requirements traceability to ensure bidirectional factor analysis is captured across all requirement types
- Validated that risk management scenarios (concentration, unintended exposure, overlap) are adequately specified
- Confirmed functional requirements align with enhanced problem statements and user stories

## Impact Assessment

### Breaking Changes
- None - these are enhancements to existing requirements specification (document still in draft status)

### Requirements Coverage Impact
- **Enhanced Factor Analysis Coverage**: Requirements now comprehensively address both performance attribution and risk management needs
- **Risk Management Capabilities**: Added specific capabilities for concentration risk, unintended exposure, and factor overlap detection
- **Bidirectional Analysis**: Clear specification for both factor→performance and ticker→factor analysis directions
- **Comprehensive Asset Grouping**: All performance metrics (TWR, MWR, risk metrics, factor attribution) now support flexible grouping across portfolio, account, ticker, and factor dimensions

## Follow-up Actions

### Immediate
- Continue requirements document review process
- Address any additional requirements gaps identified during review
- Finalize requirements document for implementation planning

### Future
- Begin implementation planning based on three-phase priority structure
- Validate requirements against actual implementation complexity during development

## Technical Details

### Enhanced Risk Management Scenarios
- **Concentration Risk Example**: "80% of international diversification comes from just 2 ETFs"
- **Unintended Exposure Example**: "Several 'US equity' holdings have significant emerging market components" 
- **Factor Overlap Example**: "Multiple holdings providing redundant crypto exposure through different crypto ETFs"

### Implementation Notes
- Requirements maintain focus on static factor weights for initial release
- Enhanced factor analysis leverages existing portopt UNDEFINED factor handling logic
- Risk management capabilities designed to provide actionable insights for portfolio rebalancing decisions
- **Asset grouping capabilities**: Flexible grouping system enables granular performance analysis across all dimensions (portfolio/account/ticker/factor)
- **Consistent API design**: Same grouping parameters work across TWR, MWR, risk metrics, and factor attribution methods
