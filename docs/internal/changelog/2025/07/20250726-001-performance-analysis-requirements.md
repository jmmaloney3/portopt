# Performance Analysis Requirements Specification Creation

## Context
Conducted comprehensive structured requirements gathering interview to address the critical "flying blind" problem where portfolio managers lack objective performance metrics to evaluate investment decisions and portfolio performance.

## Changes Made

### Documentation Changes
- Created `docs/internal/specs/performance-analysis.md` - Complete requirements specification following the requirements template
- Comprehensive 47-page requirements document covering business requirements, functional requirements, developer experience requirements, non-functional requirements, and technical constraints
- Full traceability matrix linking 3 problem statements → 3 objectives → 7 user stories → 10 functional requirements
- Detailed API design considerations following existing portopt design principles

### Requirements Specification Includes
- **Business Requirements**: 3 problem statements, 3 OKRs with measurable key results, 7 detailed user stories
- **Functional Requirements**: 10 requirements covering TWR/MWR calculation, factor attribution, transaction integration, benchmark comparison
- **Developer Experience Requirements**: API design patterns, error handling, documentation standards, learning curve considerations
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance targets (<30 seconds for basic calculations, 8GB RAM limit), reliability requirements, security considerations
- **Technical Constraints**: Platform requirements (Python 3.12.7+, macOS, Jupyter notebooks), dependency constraints, version compatibility

### Architectural Decisions Captured
- Performance analysis will use new `performance.py` module with PerformanceMixin pattern
- Transaction data integration following existing `holdings.py` patterns with TransactionsMixin
- API design following `metrics.py` patterns for consistency
- Integration with bt/ffn frameworks for standardized backtesting and performance formats
- Factor attribution using existing portopt UNDEFINED factor handling logic

## Testing Performed
- Requirements validation through structured interview process covering all requirement types
- Traceability validation ensuring all business problems map to technical solutions
- API design review against existing portopt design principles
- Performance target validation against expected data scale (50 tickers, 10 accounts, 25 factors, ~430 transactions over 5 years)

## Impact Assessment

### Breaking Changes
- None - this is additive functionality creating new performance analysis capabilities

### Performance Impact
- Establishes performance targets for new functionality: <30 seconds for basic calculations, <60 seconds for complex factor attribution
- Memory usage constraint: <8GB (50% of development environment capacity)

## Follow-up Actions

### Immediate
- User review of requirements specification document for feedback and validation
- Begin implementation planning and task breakdown based on the three-phase priority structure defined in requirements

### Future
- Implementation of Phase 1 (Core Performance Analysis): TWR calculation, time period handling, basic risk metrics, transaction integration
- Implementation of Phase 2 (Factor Attribution): Factor attribution analysis, factor weight handling, benchmark comparison
- Implementation of Phase 3 (Advanced Analysis): MWR calculation, factor concentration analysis, alternative portfolio calculation

## Technical Details

### Architecture Changes
- New performance analysis capabilities will extend existing Portfolio class through mixin pattern
- Transaction data handling will follow established portopt patterns for CSV loading and processing
- Performance calculations will integrate with existing factor weight system and metrics calculation infrastructure

### Implementation Notes
- Requirements specify static factor weights for initial release (dynamic factor weights deferred to future requirements)
- Missing data handling supports 5 configurable strategies: forward-fill, interpolation, skip gaps, require complete data, calculate only complete periods
- Transaction reconciliation follows warn-and-continue approach rather than halt-on-error for practical usability
