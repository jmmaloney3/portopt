# Persona Scope Clarification and Requirements Template Updates

## Context
During requirements validation, we identified that the persona documentation in the performance-analysis.md requirements document was creating confusion about project scope. The document implied that all persona needs must be met by the current project, when in fact personas are intended to provide context for design decisions while the actual project scope is defined by Problem Statements. This session clarified persona scope and updated both the performance analysis requirements and the requirements template to ensure consistent messaging.

## Changes Made

### Documentation Changes
- **docs/internal/specs/performance-analysis.md**:
  - Updated Personas section overview paragraph to clarify that personas provide context and that "it is unlikely that all the needs of a persona are covered by the requirements contained in this document"
  - Improved Primary Personas description to specify "user types that the requirements in this document are intended to directly support" rather than "whose needs must be satisfied for success"
  - Enhanced Secondary Personas description to explain they "influence design decisions but are not directly addressed by this project" and may serve as "prerequisites for future capabilities"
  - Moved P-3 (Sophisticated Individual Investor) from Primary Personas to Secondary Personas section since it will use future web applications rather than directly using the library
  - Updated Requirements Overview section to align persona descriptions with the detailed persona section language
  - Updated all traceability references to remove P-3 from Primary Personas lists in problem statements
  - Updated Quick Reference Matrix to reflect P-1 and P-2 as the only Primary Personas
  - Added complete P-3 persona definition to Secondary Personas section with proper traceability

- **docs/internal/templates/requirements-template.md**:
  - Updated Primary Personas description to match the improved language from performance-analysis.md
  - Updated Secondary Personas description to match the enhanced explanation of indirect support relationships
  - Updated Requirements Overview section to align with the clarified persona scope language

## Testing Performed
- Manual review of document structure and internal consistency across both files
- Verified that all traceability links are consistent and accurate
- Confirmed that persona classifications align with their actual usage patterns
- Validated that Requirements Overview section matches detailed persona descriptions
- Checked that no information was lost during persona reorganization

## Impact Assessment

### Breaking Changes
- None - this is a documentation-only change that clarifies scope without affecting implementation

### Performance Impact
- None - documentation changes only

### Security Considerations
- None - documentation changes only

## Follow-up Actions

### Immediate
- None - all identified follow-up actions from previous change logs have been completed

### Future
- Use the updated requirements template for future requirements documents to ensure consistent persona scope messaging
- Consider adding scope clarification examples to the template if similar confusion arises in other projects

## Related Issues/PRs

### Related Work
- Completes follow-up actions from 20250920-001-performance-analysis-requirements-alignment.md
- Completes follow-up actions from 20250922-001-performance-analysis-personas-and-traceability-updates.md
- Aligns with requirements-template.md structure and messaging

## Technical Details

### Key Insights
- Personas serve as context for understanding user needs, not as complete scope definition
- Primary personas are directly supported by current project requirements
- Secondary personas influence design decisions but are supported through future applications or combined capabilities
- Project scope is defined by Problem Statements, not by all persona needs
- Clear distinction between direct support (primary personas) and design influence (secondary personas) prevents scope confusion

### Documentation Consistency
- All three sections describing personas now use consistent language: Requirements Overview, Personas section introduction, and Primary/Secondary persona descriptions
- Traceability accurately reflects that only P-1 and P-2 are directly addressed by current requirements
- Both performance-analysis.md and requirements-template.md maintain coherent messaging about persona scope and purpose
