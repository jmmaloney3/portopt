# System Architecture Update Prompt Collaborative Enhancement

## Context
The system architecture update prompt was primarily interview-focused and positioned the AI as a passive interviewer and stenographer rather than an active design partner. The user requested enhancement to create a truly collaborative architecture design process where the AI brings architectural expertise while maintaining human control over final decisions.

## Changes Made

### Documentation Changes
- Enhanced system architecture update prompt to promote collaborative design process
- Updated AI role description to include architectural design expertise and knowledge of best practices
- Added comprehensive aesthetic preference discovery framework with example-based exploration
- Implemented context-first approach requiring understanding of project constraints and preferences before suggesting solutions
- Added iterative refinement guidance for evolving aesthetic preferences during design process
- Updated terminology throughout from "interview" to "collaborative design session"
- Added aesthetic alignment validation to quality checklist

## Testing Performed
- Reviewed prompt structure and flow for logical consistency
- Verified all collaborative principles are properly integrated
- Confirmed aesthetic preference discovery mechanisms are comprehensive
- Validated that human authority is maintained throughout the process
- Checked that AI expertise integration doesn't override project-specific context

## Impact Assessment

### Breaking Changes
- None - this is an enhancement to existing prompt functionality

### Performance Impact
- None - documentation change only

## Follow-up Actions

### Future
- Monitor usage of enhanced prompt to identify any additional collaborative patterns needed
- Consider creating similar collaborative enhancements for other design prompts in the system

## Technical Details

### Implementation Notes
- Maintained existing structured interview framework while adding collaborative elements
- Added specific guidance for handling difficult-to-articulate aesthetic preferences
- Implemented example-based discovery methods for aesthetic preference identification
- Created clear boundaries between AI expertise contribution and human decision authority
