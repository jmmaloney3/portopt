# Traceability, Formatting, and Version Field Updates

## Context
Adopt a simplified hierarchical traceability model while reducing redundancy, clarify blockquote usage in the template vs real documents, normalize persona formatting in the performance analysis spec, and introduce a document Version field separate from Target Release.

## Changes Made

### Documentation Changes
- docs/internal/templates/requirements-template.md
  - Added global formatting note clarifying blockquotes are for templates/examples only (not for real documents)
  - Simplified traceability to immediate parent-child links; retained FR "Impacts" for FR-to-FR dependencies
  - Reintroduced optional Persona â†’ Related Personas link in traceability templates
  - Expanded Traceability Validation Checklist with explicit forward and backward link requirements
  - Added Version field to Document Information
  - Removed redundant personas-specific formatting note
- docs/internal/specs/performance-analysis.md
  - Applied simplified traceability model (immediate links only; FR "Impacts" retained)
  - Kept Related Personas entries per persona as optional context
  - Converted persona sections from blockquotes to regular text formatting
  - Added Version field to Document Information; updated Last Updated and Target Release

## Testing Performed
- Manual review of Markdown rendering in editor to confirm formatting and lists render correctly
- Verified traceability sections are consistent and non-redundant

## Impact Assessment

## Follow-up Actions
