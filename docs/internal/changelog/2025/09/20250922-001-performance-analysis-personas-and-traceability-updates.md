# Performance Analysis requirements: personas added and traceability updated

## Context
We iteratively enhanced the `docs/internal/specs/performance-analysis.md` requirements to integrate well-defined personas and align traceability across problem statements, user stories, and functional requirements. This is an intermediate update prior to a planned traceability refactor.

## Changes Made

### Documentation Changes
- Updated `docs/internal/specs/performance-analysis.md`:
  - Added and integrated personas:
    - `P-1` Technical Individual Investor
    - `P-2` Backend Developer
    - `P-3` Sophisticated Individual Investor
    - `P-4` Financial Advisor/Wealth Manager (secondary)
    - Anti-personas: `AP-1` Basic Individual Investors, `AP-2` Enterprise IT Administrators
  - Filled persona sections with demographics, workflows, technical context, and traceability.
  - Updated traceability sections for all Problem Statements (PS-1..PS-3), User Stories (US-1..US-8), and Functional Requirements (FR-1..FR-10) to reference the concrete personas.
  - Updated Quick Reference Matrix to include a “Primary Personas” column.
  - Completed the Traceability Validation Checklist.
  - Updated “Last Updated” date to 2025-09-21.

## Testing Performed
- Manual validation of document structure and internal consistency.
- Verified all user stories and functional requirements now include persona-aware traceability.

## Impact Assessment

### Breaking Changes
- None.

### Performance Impact
- None (documentation-only change).

### Security Considerations
- None (documentation-only change).

## Deployment Notes
- No deployment changes required.

## Follow-up Actions

### Immediate
- None.

### Future
- Refactor traceability to a simplified hierarchical model (Personas → Problem Statements → User Stories → Functional Requirements) while retaining targeted FR “Impacts” for technical dependencies. Remove redundant cross-links to reduce maintenance overhead.
