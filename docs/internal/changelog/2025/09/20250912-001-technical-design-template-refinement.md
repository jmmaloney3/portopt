# Technical Design Template Refinement for Single Increment Focus

## Context
The technical design template was created before the introduction of system architecture and feature decomposition steps in the development process, resulting in redundancies and lack of focus on single increment design decisions. This refinement streamlines the template to focus specifically on design decisions needed before implementation for a single increment.

## Changes Made

### Documentation Changes
- **Refined document structure** to focus on single increment scope with clear references to feature decomposition and system architecture documents
- **Updated document header** to include Feature Decomposition and System Architecture links, plus Increment Scope field
- **Restructured core design sections** into High-Level Design (cast of characters approach) and Detailed Design (specific implementation details)
- **Enhanced component design guidance** with (NEW | EXISTING) status indicators and detailed guidance for modifying existing classes and functions
- **Improved data flow design** with flexible options for describing control and data flow interactions

### Removed Redundant Sections
- **Removed Implementation Timeline** section (project management, not technical design)
- **Removed Monitoring & Observability** section (moved to design-principles-and-standards.md)
- **Removed Error Handling Strategy** section (covered in design-principles-and-standards.md)
- **Removed Documentation Plan** section (covered in design-principles-and-standards.md)
- **Removed Success Criteria** section (redundant with requirements and standards)
- **Removed redundant appendices** (B, C, D) that duplicated main design sections

### Transformed Sections
- **Risk Assessment & Mitigation** → **Design Validation Concerns** (focuses on design validation rather than general risk management)
- **Testing Strategy** → **Testing Guidance** (focuses on critical testing concerns rather than general testing practices)
- **API Consistency Requirements** → **API Design Quality** (moved to validation checklist)

### Enhanced Validation Checklist
- **Simplified Design Principles & Standards Compliance** to reference design-principles-and-standards.md document
- **Refined Implementation Readiness** to provide reviewer guidance mapping to each design section
- **Merged Risk Management and Quality Assurance** into Design Validation & Testing section
- **Removed Project Management** concerns from design template

### Updated Process Integration
- **Aligned collaboration process** with template structure and previous decisions
- **Refined document maintenance** to focus on design maintenance only, referencing development process
- **Removed inappropriate items** like implementation tracking and learning capture (separate process steps)

## Testing Performed
- **Template structure validation** - Verified all sections align with single increment focus
- **Cross-reference validation** - Confirmed references to other documents are accurate
- **Process alignment validation** - Verified template aligns with development process workflow
- **Redundancy elimination** - Confirmed removed sections are covered in appropriate documents

## Impact Assessment

### Breaking Changes
- **Template structure changes** - Existing design documents using old template will need migration
- **Section removals** - Some content previously in design template now lives in other documents

### Performance Impact
- **Improved template usability** - Streamlined template reduces time to complete design documents
- **Reduced maintenance burden** - Single source of truth for standards reduces duplication

## Follow-up Actions

### Immediate
- **Update technical design prompt** to align with refined template structure
- **Create migration guide** for existing design documents using old template

### Future
- **Gather feedback** on refined template from development team
- **Iterate on template** based on usage experience and feedback

## Related Issues/PRs
- **Template refinement session** - Comprehensive review and refinement of technical design template
- **Development process alignment** - Ensures template supports incremental development workflow

## Technical Details

### Architecture Changes
- **Template structure** - Reorganized from comprehensive system design to focused increment design
- **Document relationships** - Clear separation of concerns between requirements, architecture, decomposition, and design documents

### Implementation Notes
- **Single increment focus** - Template now specifically targets design decisions for one increment
- **Reviewer guidance** - Enhanced checklist provides clear guidance for design validation
- **Process integration** - Template now properly integrates with development process workflow
