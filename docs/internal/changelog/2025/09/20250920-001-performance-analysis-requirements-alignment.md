# Performance Analysis Requirements Document Alignment with Updated Template

## Context
The performance-analysis.md requirements document was created before the requirements-template.md was updated to include personas and restructure the requirements organization. This update aligns the performance analysis requirements with the new template structure and removes redundant developer experience requirements that duplicate established design principles.

## Changes Made

### Documentation Changes
- Updated `docs/internal/specs/performance-analysis.md` to align with new requirements template structure
- Added new "Personas" section with placeholder templates for Primary, Secondary, and Anti-Personas
- Updated traceability sections throughout to include persona references
- Integrated OKRs into existing requirements and removed redundant "Strategic Objectives" section
- Added new user story US-8 for quarterly rebalancing decisions based on performance data
- Converted Developer Experience requirements (FR-11, FR-12, FR-13) into functional requirements under "Developer Experience & Integration" subsection
- Enhanced Non-Functional Requirements with decision-making and data-driven portfolio management context
- Added missing sections: Appendices (Glossary, References, Examples) and Traceability Validation Checklist
- Removed entire "Developer Experience & Integration" section (FR-11, FR-12, FR-13) as duplicates of design principles

## Testing Performed
- Reviewed document structure against requirements-template.md to ensure alignment
- Validated that all OKR content was properly integrated into existing requirements
- Confirmed that removed Developer Experience requirements are covered by design-principles-and-standards.md
- Verified traceability links are consistent throughout the document
- Checked that no unique information was lost during OKR integration and removal

## Impact Assessment

### Breaking Changes
- None - this is a documentation-only change that updates requirements structure without affecting implementation

### Performance Impact
- None - documentation changes only

## Follow-up Actions

### Immediate
- Conduct interview process to define detailed personas and complete traceability links
- Update traceability matrix table structure to remove "Objective" column
- Complete persona definitions with specific characteristics, workflows, and needs

### Future
- Validate requirement completeness against defined personas during interview
- Identify any gaps or missing requirements revealed by persona analysis
- Update traceability matrix with actual persona IDs and correct formatting
