# Technical Design Prompt Update and Alignment

## Context
Updated the technical design prompt to align with the recently updated technical design template, focusing on increment-specific design rather than system architecture, and removing redundant content that was already covered by design standards.

## Changes Made

### Documentation Changes
- Updated `docs/internal/prompts/technical-design-prompt.md` to align with technical design template structure
- Refined language throughout to focus on increment design rather than complete feature design
- Updated AI agent specialization from "software architecture" to "software design" to better match increment-level focus
- Removed redundant questions about increment dependencies and interfaces (already covered in feature decomposition document)
- Updated "Implementation learnings from previous increments" to reference specific learning capture documents
- Removed redundant "success criteria for this design" question (covered by Quality Checklist)
- Consolidated component design questions to use "components" consistently as umbrella term
- Removed redundant testing questions already covered by design principles and standards
- Removed redundant documentation questions already covered by design principles and standards
- Removed duplicate Design Validation Checklist (template is authoritative source)
- Added clear instructions for handling architectural issues during increment design
- Updated architectural issue handling to reference "Architectural Issues Identified" appendix instead of "Design Validation Concerns"
- Simplified Document Generation section to reference template structure directly
- Added explicit instruction to validate generated document against template checklist

### Code Quality Improvements
- Performed careful contextual review of "implementation" vs "design" terminology usage
- Ensured consistent use of "design" for planning/specification phase and "implementation" for actual coding/development phase
- Improved prompt structure and flow for better usability

## Testing Performed
- Manual review of prompt alignment with template structure
- Verification that all template sections are covered by prompt questions
- Confirmation that redundant content was properly identified and removed
- Validation that architectural issue handling instructions match template structure

## Impact Assessment

### Breaking Changes
- None - this is a documentation update that doesn't affect existing functionality

### Performance Impact
- None - documentation changes only

## Follow-up Actions

### Immediate
- Prompt is ready for use in technical design interviews
- Template and prompt are now fully aligned

### Future
- Consider developing collaborative design prompt as discussed for cases where design exploration is needed rather than systematic documentation
