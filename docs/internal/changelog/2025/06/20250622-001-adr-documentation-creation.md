# ADR Documentation Creation and METRICS.md Refactoring

## Context

The user requested creation of Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) to document two critical problems encountered during the MetricsMixin development: the Double Counting Problem and Undefined Factor Handling. The existing METRICS.md file contained lengthy technical explanations that would be better organized as dedicated ADRs following a structured template. The user provided an ADR directory with a template and requested moving the detailed problem descriptions into separate ADR documents while updating METRICS.md to reference them.

## Changes Made

### Documentation Changes
- **Created**: `docs/internal/adr/001-double-counting-prevention.md` - Comprehensive ADR documenting the factor weight pre-aggregation solution with 4 considered options, decision rationale, and implementation details
- **Created**: `docs/internal/adr/002-undefined-factor-handling.md` - Detailed ADR for UNDEFINED factor category approach with 5 considered options (including "throw exception" option added per user feedback)
- **Modified**: `docs/internal/METRICS.md` - Replaced detailed "Double-Counting Prevention" and "Undefined Factor Handling" sections with concise summaries and ADR references
- **Updated**: `docs/internal/adr/README.md` - Added catalog of active ADRs with brief descriptions and fixed typo ("templates" → "template")

## Testing

### Manual Testing Performed
- Verified ADR markdown formatting and internal links work correctly
- Confirmed METRICS.md references resolve to the correct ADR sections
- Validated both ADRs follow the template structure with proper YAML frontmatter
- Tested that the naive aggregation SQL example was properly incorporated into ADR-001

## Impact Assessment

### Breaking Changes
- Documentation restructuring may require users to update bookmarks to specific sections

### Performance Impact
- Improved documentation navigation and maintainability

## Deployment Notes

### Rollback Plan
- Simple git revert if documentation structure needs to be reverted
- Original content preserved in git history

## Follow-up Actions

### Immediate
- Monitor for any broken documentation links
- Ensure ADR references are accessible to all team members

### Future
- Consider creating additional ADRs for other architectural decisions in the codebase
- Develop tooling for ADR template validation and cross-reference checking

## Related Issues/PRs

### Issues Resolved
- Addresses documentation organization concerns where METRICS.md contained overly detailed technical explanations
- Provides structured decision documentation for the critical double-counting and undefined factor handling problems

### Related Work
- Builds on previous MetricsMixin implementation work documented in `src/portopt/metrics.py`
- References comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_metrics.py` that validates both solutions
- Supports the Portfolio class integration that replaced buggy `getMetrics` method with MetricsMixin

## Technical Details

### Architecture Changes
- Established ADR documentation pattern following industry best practices
- Created clear separation between high-level architecture overview and detailed decision analysis

### Implementation Notes
- Used standard ADR template structure with YAML frontmatter including status, date, decision-makers, consulted, and informed fields
- Followed naming convention: `NNN-brief-descriptive-title.md` (001-double-counting-prevention, 002-undefined-factor-handling)
- Included comprehensive analysis: context, 4-5 considered options with pros/cons, decision rationale, consequences, and confirmation methods
- Added naive aggregation SQL example to ADR-001 per user request to make the problem more concrete
- Incorporated user feedback about the "throw exception" option in ADR-002

### Code Quality
- Improved documentation maintainability through modular structure
- Enhanced future developer onboarding with clear decision rationale
- Established pattern for documenting future architectural decisions

## Verification

### How to Verify
1. Navigate to `docs/internal/adr/` directory
2. Confirm both ADR files exist and follow template structure
3. Open `docs/internal/METRICS.md` and verify ADR links work
4. Check that README.md lists the new ADRs correctly

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Both ADRs created with comprehensive content
- ✅ METRICS.md successfully refactored with ADR references  
- ✅ All internal links resolve correctly
- ✅ Documentation follows established template structure
- ✅ ADR catalog updated in README.md
