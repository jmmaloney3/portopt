# Fix Double-Counting Bug and Refactor Metrics to Use Mixin Architecture

## Context

Critical double-counting bug discovered in factor-weighted portfolio metrics where securities with multiple factor exposures were being counted multiple times, leading to inflated portfolio values. Additionally, tickers without factor weight definitions were being excluded from factor-based metrics, creating incomplete portfolio views. The existing Portfolio.getMetrics() method had complex, hard-to-maintain SQL generation logic that was prone to errors. This required both fixing the mathematical bugs and refactoring to a cleaner, more maintainable architecture using a dedicated MetricsMixin class.

## Changes Made

### Code Changes
- **Created**: `src/portopt/metrics.py` - New MetricsMixin class with comprehensive factor weight handling
- **Modified**: `src/portopt/portfolio.py` - Refactored Portfolio class to inherit from MetricsMixin, removed buggy getMetrics implementation (~200 lines)
- **Enhanced**: `tests/test_metrics.py` - Added comprehensive test suite with mathematical verification and regression tests
- **Eliminated ~200 lines of complex SQL generation** - Replaced with maintainable ibis-based approach
- **Improved separation of concerns** - Metrics logic isolated from core Portfolio functionality
- **Enhanced testability** - MetricsMixin can be tested independently with mock data
- **Consistent code formatting** - Cleaned up whitespace issues throughout codebase

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed critical double-counting bug** - Factor-weighted metrics now mathematically correct
- **Resolved allocation calculation errors** - Portfolio vs filtered allocation now works correctly
- **Fixed incomplete portfolio coverage** - Tickers without factor weights now included in factor-based metrics via UNDEFINED category
- **Fixed query ordering issues** - Added `.sort_index()` calls to handle SQL result ordering differences

### Automated Test Changes
- **Added 17 comprehensive test cases** to `tests/test_metrics.py` covering all parameter combinations and edge cases
- **Added regression test** - `test_original_double_counting_bug_with_factor_filters()` validates the original bug fix
- **Added mathematical verification tests** - Compare SQL results against manual calculations for accuracy
- **Enhanced test data generation** - `create_comprehensive_test_data()` with multiple accounts, tickers, factor levels
- **Added edge case tests** - Coverage for missing factor weights, invalid dimensions, empty results
- **Added integration tests** - Ensuring Portfolio class works seamlessly with new MetricsMixin

### Dependency Changes
- **Added ibis library** - Analytics framework for expressing complex queries, enables maintainable SQL generation with DuckDB backend

### Documentation Changes
- **Updated notebook examples** - `notebooks/eval-proto/duckdb.ipynb` with factor weight pre-aggregation queries
- **Added comprehensive docstrings** - Full API documentation for MetricsMixin methods
- **Improved error messages** - Clear guidance on available options when validation fails
- **Created [ADR-001](../../adr/001-double-counting-prevention.md)** - Architectural Decision Record for Factor Weight Pre-Aggregation to Prevent Double Counting
- **Created [ADR-002](../../adr/002-undefined-factor-handling.md)** - Architectural Decision Record for UNDEFINED Factor Category for Tickers Without Factor Weights

## Testing Performed
- **Ran complete test suite** - `python -m pytest tests/test_metrics.py -v` (all 17 tests pass)
- **Verified fix for original bug scenario** - `portfolio.getMetrics('Account', filters={'Level_0': ['Equity']}, portfolio_allocation=True)` now returns mathematically correct values
- **Tested all dimension combinations** - Ticker, Account, Factor, Level_* with various filters
- **Validated allocation calculations** - Both portfolio_allocation=True/False scenarios
- **Verified Portfolio class integration** - `portfolio.getMetrics('Ticker')` works seamlessly with new MetricsMixin
- **Tested undefined factor handling** - Verified tickers without factor weights appear in UNDEFINED category with correct allocations
- **Confirmed total value consistency** - Portfolio totals match between ticker-based and factor-based groupings
- **Tested comprehensive coverage** - Various dimension combinations and filter scenarios
- **Confirmed whitespace cleanup** - Removed leading/trailing whitespace throughout codebase

## Impact Assessment

### Performance Impact
- **Improved query efficiency** - Lazy table loading based on actual requirements
- **Better memory usage** - Only loads factor tables when needed for dimensions/filters
- **Optimized aggregations** - Pre-aggregation reduces complexity of final GROUP BY operations

### Security Considerations
- **Input validation enhanced** - Comprehensive dimension validation prevents SQL injection risks
- **Error handling improved** - Clear error messages without exposing internal implementation details

## Technical Details

### Architecture Changes
- **MetricsMixin design pattern** - Composable metrics functionality that can be mixed into Portfolio class, providing clean separation of metrics logic from core Portfolio class
- **Query pipeline architecture** - Structured 5-stage pipeline: Table Loading → Base Query → Filtering → Aggregation → Allocation
- **Factor table requirements logic** - `_requires_factor_tables()` method determines when to load factor data based on dimensions and filters
- **Factor weight pre-aggregation solution** - `_aggregate_factor_weights()` prevents double-counting by consolidating fractional weights before final metrics calculation
- **Comprehensive undefined factor handling** - `_handle_undefined_factor_weights()` assigns structured UNDEFINED category to tickers without factor weights, ensuring 100% portfolio coverage
- **Centralized dimension validation** - Clear error messages for invalid dimension requests with available options

### Implementation Notes
- **Used ibis query framework** - Leverages DuckDB backend for efficient SQL generation and execution
- **Implemented LEFT JOIN strategy** - Preserves all positions while handling missing factor weights gracefully
- **Added COALESCE for undefined factors** - Assigns structured "UNDEFINED" category matching factor hierarchy (Level_0='UNDEFINED', Level_1+='N/A', Weight=1.0)
- **Centralized table requirements logic** - `_requires_factor_tables()` optimizes which tables to load
- **Considered multiple undefined factor approaches** - Evaluated exclusion, default assignment, separate metrics, and exception throwing before choosing structured UNDEFINED category
