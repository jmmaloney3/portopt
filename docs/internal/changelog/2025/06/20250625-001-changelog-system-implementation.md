# Implement Comprehensive Changelog System

## Context

The project needed a structured way to track changes made by AI agents and humans to provide accountability, context preservation, and debugging support. The existing ADR system needed to be complemented with a granular change tracking system for implementation details.

## Changes Made

### Documentation Changes
- **Created**: `docs/internal/changelog/README.md` - Comprehensive documentation of the changelog system philosophy, structure, and usage
- **Created**: `docs/internal/changelog/000-changelog-template.md` - Template for creating consistent changelog entries with REQUIRED/OPTIONAL section markings
- **Created**: `docs/internal/changelog/2025/06/20250614-001-metrics-double-counting-fix.md` - Retroactive changelog entry for MetricsMixin work
- **Created**: `docs/internal/changelog/2025/06/20250622-001-adr-documentation-creation.md` - Retroactive changelog entry for ADR creation work

### Code Changes
- **Created directory structure**: `docs/internal/changelog/YYYY/MM/` hierarchy for scalable organization

## Testing Performed

- **Validated template structure** - Tested changelog template by creating actual entries and ensuring all sections work correctly
- **Verified cross-references** - Confirmed links between changelog entries function properly
- **Tested directory structure** - Verified hierarchical organization works for file navigation and discovery
- **Validated metadata fields** - Confirmed all metadata fields (entry_id, agent, human, session_id, etc.) populate correctly
- **Reviewed content completeness** - Ensured all major architectural decisions and changes are properly documented
- **Tested naming conventions** - Verified YYYYMMDD-xxx-description.md format works for chronological sorting

## Impact Assessment

### Performance Impact
- **Documentation discoverability improved** - Structured approach makes it easier to find relevant change information
- **Reduced debugging time** - Granular change tracking enables faster identification of when issues were introduced

### Security Considerations
- **Enhanced accountability** - Clear attribution of changes to specific agents and humans
- **Audit trail established** - Comprehensive record of who made what changes and when

## Technical Details

### Architecture Changes
- **Hierarchical changelog organization** - YYYY/MM directory structure prevents directory bloat and enables chronological navigation
- **Content-only template approach** - Sections can be omitted entirely rather than including "No changes" text
- **Complementary documentation system** - Changelogs for implementation tracking complement existing ADR system for architectural decisions
- **Metadata-driven approach** - Structured YAML frontmatter enables future automation and indexing

### Implementation Notes
- **Scalable naming convention** - YYYYMMDD-xxx-description.md format supports multiple entries per day with clear chronological ordering
- **Template-driven consistency** - Single authoritative template prevents documentation fragmentation
- **Cross-referencing strategy** - Links between changelogs and existing ADRs enable comprehensive traceability
- **Session tracking integration** - Human-provided session IDs enable tracing back to specific AI conversations

### Design Decisions
- **Chose date-based over version-based organization** - Better suits continuous development and AI-assisted workflows
- **Integrated with existing ADR system** - Changelogs focus on "what" was implemented, complementing ADRs that document "why" decisions were made
- **Required vs optional sections** - Clear guidance prevents incomplete documentation while maintaining flexibility
- **Content-only philosophy** - Eliminates empty sections and focuses on actual information rather than template compliance
