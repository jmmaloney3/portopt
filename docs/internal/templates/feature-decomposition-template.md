## Acceptable Rework Trade-offs

### Early Delivery Philosophy
We accept the risk of some interface rework in order to deliver value to users sooner and get feedback before investing too heavily in any particular direction. The cost of potential interface refactoring is generally less than the cost of building the wrong thing or missing critical feedback opportunities.

### Early Delivery Benefits
- **Increment 1**: [What value/feedback we get by delivering this increment early]
- **Increment 2**: [What value/feedback we get by delivering this increment early]
- **User Feedback**: [What assumptions we can validate early with real usage]

### Potential Rework Costs
- **[Interface 1]**: [How this interface might need refactoring based on later learnings]
- **[Interface 2]**: [Technical debt we're accepting to deliver value sooner]
- **[Design Decision X]**: [Where we might need to refactor based on user feedback]

### Rework Mitigation Strategies
- **Conservative Interface Design**: [How we'll design interfaces to minimize changes]
- **Early Validation**: [What we'll validate early to reduce rework risk]
- **Modular Architecture**: [How modular design reduces rework impact]

## Template Usage Notes

### Decomposition Criteria Used
- **Functional Independence**: Each increment can be implemented and tested in isolation
- **User Value**: Each increment provides meaningful value to users when complete  
- **Technical Boundaries**: Clear interfaces between increments
- **Implementation Size**: 1-3 weeks of development work per increment
- **Learning Opportunities**: Increments designed to maximize learning and reduce risk

### Systems Engineering Principles Applied
- **Holistic System View**: Increments designed to work together coherently
- **Requirements Traceability**: Each increment traces back to specific requirements
- **Risk Management**: High-risk areas tackled early to fail fast
- **Value-Driven Sequencing**: Increment order optimizes for early user value delivery
- **Interface Management**: Clear specification of how increments integrate

### Success Validation
This decomposition succeeds if:
- Users get valuable functionality incrementally rather than waiting for complete feature
- Technical risks are identified and mitigated early through implementation
- Each increment teaches us something important about the remaining work
- The final system architecture is coherent and maintainable
- Development team can work efficiently with clear increment boundaries
