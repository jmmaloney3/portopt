## Template Usage Notes

### Decomposition Criteria Used
- **Functional Independence**: Each increment can be implemented and tested in isolation
- **User Value**: Each increment provides meaningful value to users when complete  
- **Technical Boundaries**: Clear interfaces between increments
- **Implementation Size**: 1-3 weeks of development work per increment
- **Learning Opportunities**: Increments designed to maximize learning and reduce risk

### Systems Engineering Principles Applied
- **Holistic System View**: Increments designed to work together coherently
- **Requirements Traceability**: Each increment traces back to specific requirements
- **Risk Management**: High-risk areas tackled early to fail fast
- **Value-Driven Sequencing**: Increment order optimizes for early user value delivery
- **Interface Management**: Clear specification of how increments integrate

### Success Validation
This decomposition succeeds if:
- Users get valuable functionality incrementally rather than waiting for complete feature
- Each increment teaches us something important about the remaining work
- The final system architecture is coherent and maintainable
- Dependencies between increments are clear and manageable
- Each increment section provides complete information needed for planning and implementation
