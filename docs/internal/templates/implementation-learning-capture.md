# Implementation Learning Capture Template

Use this template to capture learnings from each increment implementation and inform design decisions for subsequent increments.

## Increment Information

**Increment**: [Increment name]  
**Implementation Period**: [Start date] - [End date]
**Team Members**: [Who worked on this increment]

## Design Assumptions Validated

Document design assumptions that were proven correct during implementation:

- **[Assumption 1]**: [Description of assumption]
  - **How validated**: [Specific evidence from implementation that confirmed this]
  - **Confidence level**: [High/Medium/Low confidence in validation]

- **[Assumption 2]**: [Description of assumption]
  - **How validated**: [Specific evidence from implementation that confirmed this]
  - **Confidence level**: [High/Medium/Low confidence in validation]

## Design Assumptions Invalidated

Document design assumptions that were proven incorrect during implementation:

- **[Assumption 1]**: [Description of assumption that was wrong]
  - **Why invalidated**: [What we discovered that contradicted this assumption]
  - **What we learned instead**: [The actual reality we discovered]
  - **Impact on future increments**: [How this affects remaining design and implementation]

- **[Assumption 2]**: [Description of assumption that was wrong]
  - **Why invalidated**: [What we discovered that contradicted this assumption]
  - **What we learned instead**: [The actual reality we discovered]
  - **Impact on future increments**: [How this affects remaining design and implementation]

## New Technical Insights

Document unexpected discoveries and technical insights gained during implementation:

- **[Insight 1]**: [Technical discovery or pattern that emerged]
  - **Implications**: [What this means for system design or architecture]
  - **Opportunities**: [New possibilities this insight creates]
  - **Risks**: [New risks this insight reveals]

- **[Insight 2]**: [Technical discovery or pattern that emerged]
  - **Implications**: [What this means for system design or architecture]
  - **Opportunities**: [New possibilities this insight creates]
  - **Risks**: [New risks this insight reveals]

## Interface Changes Required

Document changes needed to interfaces between increments:

- **[Interface 1]**: [Name of interface that needs changes]
  - **Current design**: [What was originally planned]
  - **Required changes**: [What needs to change and why]
  - **Impact on dependent increments**: [Which future increments are affected]
  - **Backward compatibility**: [Whether changes break existing functionality]

- **[Interface 2]**: [Name of interface that needs changes]
  - **Current design**: [What was originally planned]
  - **Required changes**: [What needs to change and why]
  - **Impact on dependent increments**: [Which future increments are affected]
  - **Backward compatibility**: [Whether changes break existing functionality]

## Performance and Quality Discoveries

Document performance, reliability, or quality insights discovered during implementation:

- **Performance**: [Any performance characteristics discovered - better or worse than expected]
- **Reliability**: [Reliability patterns or issues discovered]
- **Maintainability**: [Code maintainability insights]
- **Testing**: [Testing approach effectiveness and insights]

## User Value and Feedback

Document user value delivered and any feedback received:

- **Value Delivered**: [Specific value this increment provides to users]
- **User Feedback**: [Any feedback received from early usage or demos]
- **Usage Patterns**: [How users actually interact with the functionality vs expectations]

## Recommendations for Next Increment

Provide specific, actionable guidance for the next increment's design session:

### Architecture and Design Recommendations

- **[Recommendation 1]**: [Specific architectural guidance]
  - **Rationale**: [Why this recommendation based on current learnings]
  - **Priority**: [High/Medium/Low priority for next increment]

- **[Recommendation 2]**: [Specific design pattern guidance]
  - **Rationale**: [Why this recommendation based on current learnings]
  - **Priority**: [High/Medium/Low priority for next increment]

### Implementation Approach Recommendations

- **[Recommendation 1]**: [Specific implementation approach guidance]
  - **Rationale**: [Why this approach based on current learnings]
  - **Priority**: [High/Medium/Low priority for next increment]

- **[Recommendation 2]**: [Specific technical approach guidance]
  - **Rationale**: [Why this approach based on current learnings]
  - **Priority**: [High/Medium/Low priority for next increment]

### Risk Mitigation Recommendations

- **[Risk 1]**: [Specific risk to watch out for in next increment]
  - **Mitigation**: [How to address or validate this risk early]
  - **Early warning signs**: [How to detect if this risk is materializing]

- **[Risk 2]**: [Specific risk to watch out for in next increment]
  - **Mitigation**: [How to address or validate this risk early]
  - **Early warning signs**: [How to detect if this risk is materializing]

## Usage Notes

**When to Complete**: Fill out this template immediately after increment completion, while implementation details are fresh.

**Review Process**: Review with team lead and stakeholders before starting design session for next increment.

**Integration**: Use findings from this template to inform the design gathering session for the next increment.
