## Executive Summary

[2-3 sentence summary of what this requirement addresses and why it matters]

*Formatting note: In this file, templates and examples are presented using blockquotes (>) to visually distinguish template content. When authoring actual requirements documents, DO NOT use blockquotes for content. Render personas, problem statements, user stories, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and constraints as regular headings and body text.*

## Requirements Overview

This document organizes requirements into four interconnected types that work together to ensure complete coverage from business need to system requirements:

### **Personas** → **WHO**
Define the key user archetypes and their characteristics that provide context for understanding user needs and drive design decisions.
- **Primary Personas**: User types whose specific needs are directly addressed by this project's requirements
- **Secondary Personas**: User types whose needs influence design decisions but are not directly addressed by this project
- **Anti-Personas**: User types explicitly not targeted or supported

### **Business Requirements** → **WHY**
Define the fundamental problems and user value that justify this development effort.
- **Problem Statements**: Core challenges and pain points that need solving
- **User Stories**: Specific user-centered solutions that deliver business value

### **Functional Requirements** → **WHAT**
Define the core capabilities and behaviors the system must provide, independent of how users access them.
- System capabilities, business logic, data processing, and computational features
- Focus on what the system does, not how developers interact with it

### **Non-Functional Requirements** → **HOW WELL**
Define quality attributes and performance characteristics the system must exhibit.
- Performance, reliability, security requirements that apply to system behavior
- Measurable quality standards independent of specific functionality

### **Technical Constraints** → **WITHIN WHAT LIMITS**
Define environmental limitations and compatibility requirements the system must operate within.
- Platform support, dependency constraints, compatibility requirements
- External factors that constrain implementation choices

### **Requirements Flow**
Adopt a simplified hierarchical traceability model that reduces redundancy while preserving clarity:
- Personas → Problem Statements → User Stories → Functional Requirements
- Keep only immediate parent-child links; derive longer chains when needed
- Retain targeted cross-links only where they add unique value (e.g., FR "Impacts" for FR-to-FR dependencies)

**User Foundation:**
- **Personas** → Define who we're building for

**Business Foundation:**
- **Problem Statements** → Identify core challenges
- **User Stories** → Translate into user-centered solutions

**System Requirements:**
- **Functional Requirements** → Define system capabilities (WHAT)
- **Non-Functional Requirements** → Define quality attributes (HOW WELL)

**Constraints:** All technical requirements operate within **Technical Constraints** (platform, compatibility, dependencies)

*Note: For developer-facing libraries, Functional requirements define the system capabilities that developers will use. For end-user facing applications, Functional requirements define the system capabilities that support user interactions. All trace back to the same User Stories and address the core system capabilities needed to deliver value.*

## Personas
*Personas are detailed, semi-fictional representations of key user archetypes that help ensure requirements remain user-centered and realistic. They provide context for understanding user needs, behaviors, goals, and constraints. Well-defined personas help validate that business requirements, user stories, and technical requirements all address real user needs and create meaningful value. For developer-facing libraries, personas should focus on different types of developers, analysts, and technical users. For end-user facing applications, personas should represent the target end users who will interact with the user interface.*

### Primary Personas
*Primary personas represent the main user types that the requirements in this document are intended to directly support. These users' goals and workflows drive the core functionality and design decisions. While not all of a primary persona's needs may be addressed by this project, the documented requirements are specifically designed to directly serve these users.*

## Business Requirements
*Business requirements capture the WHY behind any development effort - the fundamental problems that need solving and the user value to deliver. This section establishes the business justification and user-centered foundation for all technical work that follows.*

*Business requirements consist of two interconnected components:*
- *Problem Statements identify the core challenges*
- *User Stories translate business needs into specific user-centered solutions*

*Unlike functional or technical requirements that focus on system capabilities, business requirements focus on human needs and business value. Every technical requirement should trace back to these business requirements to ensure development efforts remain aligned with actual user problems and business needs.*

### Problem Statements
*Problem statements define the core challenges and pain points that drive the need for new functionality. They serve as the foundation for all subsequent requirements by clearly articulating who is affected, what they're trying to accomplish, and why current solutions are inadequate. Well-written problem statements ensure that user stories and technical requirements all trace back to real user needs and business value.*

*For developer-facing libraries, problem statements should focus on developer workflow challenges, API limitations, or gaps in functionality. For end-user facing applications, problem statements should focus on user interface limitations, workflow inefficiencies, or gaps in user experience that prevent users from achieving their goals efficiently.*

#### Primary Problem
**Problem Statement Template:**

> **PS-[#]**: [Brief description of the problem from user/stakeholder perspective]
> - **Who**: [Specific user persona or stakeholder group]
> - **What**: [What are they trying to accomplish?]

> - **Addresses**: [Optional - parent problem PS-ID if a true hierarchy exists]
> - **Addressed By**: [US-IDs that tackle this problem]
> - **Related Problems**: [Other PS-IDs that are related or dependent]

**Example:**

- **Conditional Behavior**: "When [trigger/condition], the system must [action] [object]"
- **Input/Output**: "Given [input/data], the system must [process/calculate] and return [output]"

**Priority Levels ([MoSCoW Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method)):**
- **Must have**: Critical to current delivery for it to be a success. Without this, the project delivery should be considered a failure.
- **Should have**: Important but not necessary for current delivery. Often not as time-critical or there may be alternative ways to satisfy the requirement.
- **Could have**: Desirable but not necessary. Could improve user experience or satisfaction for little development cost. Included if time and resources permit.
- **Won't have**: Least-critical, lowest-payback items, or not appropriate at this time. Not planned for the current delivery but may be reconsidered for future releases.

## Non-Functional Requirements
*These specify quality attributes that the implemented system must meet. Unlike Definition of Done (which defines process and quality gates for story completion), these define measurable characteristics of the system itself.*

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: [Acceptable execution time for typical use cases]
- **Throughput**: [Number of operations per second/minute/hour]
- **Memory Usage**: [Memory constraints or expectations]
- **Scalability**: [How should it scale with data size/portfolio count]

**Examples:**

> - Portfolio volatility calculation must complete within 100ms for portfolios containing up to 500 assets
> - CSV file format validation must display errors within 5 seconds of upload
> - Factor exposure calculations must process 100 portfolios within 30 seconds

### Reliability Requirements
- **Availability**: [System uptime expectations]
- **Error Recovery**: [How should errors be handled and recovered from]
- **Data Validation**: [Input validation and data integrity requirements]
- **Edge Cases**: [Known edge cases to handle gracefully]

### Security Requirements
- **Data Protection**: [How sensitive data should be handled]
- **Input Validation**: [Security-related input validation requirements]
- **Access Control**: [Any access control requirements]

## Technical Constraints

*Technical constraints define limitations or requirements that the system must operate within. These should be expressed as constraints on system behavior or capabilities, not as design decisions about how to implement the system.*

### Platform Requirements
- **Operating System Support**: [Which operating systems the system must support]
- **Python Version Compatibility**: [Minimum and maximum Python versions required]
- **Hardware Requirements**: [Minimum hardware specifications needed]

### Dependency Constraints
- **Required Compatibility**: [External systems or libraries this feature must be compatible with]
- **Prohibited Dependencies**: [Dependencies that cannot be used due to licensing, security, or policy constraints]
- **Version Constraints**: [Specific version requirements for critical dependencies]

**Examples:**
> - Must be compatible with Python 3.8+ through Python 3.12
> - Must run on Windows 10+, macOS 12+, and Ubuntu 20.04+
> - Must work with NumPy 1.20+ and Pandas 1.3+
> - Cannot introduce GPL-licensed dependencies
> - Must integrate with existing Jupyter notebook environments

**Note on API Backwards Compatibility:**
*API backwards compatibility is governed by the project-wide [API Compatibility Policy](../development-process.md#api-compatibility-policy). Individual requirements should only specify compatibility constraints when they differ from or add to the standard policy.*

## Traceability Summary

### Quick Reference Matrix
*This matrix provides a high-level overview of traceability relationships. Detailed traceability information is maintained in each individual item's "Traceability" section.*

*Note: For developer-facing libraries, user stories typically generate functional requirements that define system capabilities. The relationships between requirements are flexible - not every user story needs multiple functional requirements, and some functional requirements may span multiple user stories.*

| Persona | Problem Statement | User Story | Requirements Generated | Status |

| P-1 | PS-1 | US-1 | FR-1, FR-3 | [Not Started/In Progress/Complete] |
| P-1, P-2 | PS-1 | US-2 | FR-2, FR-4 | [Not Started/In Progress/Complete] |
| P-2 | PS-2 | US-3 | FR-5, FR-6 | [Not Started/In Progress/Complete] |

*Example interpretations:*
- *US-1 generates multiple functional capabilities (FR-1, FR-3) for portfolio risk analysis*
- *US-2 generates internal functionality (FR-2, FR-4) for alternative optimization strategies*
- *US-3 generates functional capabilities (FR-5, FR-6) for comprehensive risk analysis*

### Traceability Validation Checklist
*Use this checklist to ensure traceability is complete and accurate while avoiding redundant links.*

Required forward links:
- [ ] Persona → Problem Statement(s) (Primary Problems)
- [ ] Problem Statement → User Story(ies) (Addressed By)
- [ ] User Story → Functional Requirement(s) (Implemented By)

Required backward links:
- [ ] Functional Requirement → User Story (User Story)
- [ ] User Story → Problem Statement (Addresses Problem)
- [ ] Problem Statement → Persona(s) (Primary Personas)

Optional/contextual links:
- [ ] Problem Statement → Parent Problem (Addresses) when a true hierarchy exists
- [ ] Functional Requirement → FR (Impacts) for FR-to-FR dependencies
- [ ] Persona → Related Personas for collaboration/hand-offs (does not affect required chain)

General rules:
- [ ] No orphans: Every FR traces to a US; every US traces to a PS; every PS links to at least one Persona
- [ ] Immediate links only in bodies; derive longer chains when needed
- [ ] Cross-links are targeted and add unique value

## Requirements Writing Guidance

### Universal Quality Criteria

Every requirement (Persona, Problem Statement, User Story, Functional Requirement) should be:
- [ ] **Clear & Unambiguous**: Uses precise language that cannot be misinterpreted
- [ ] **Verifiable**: Can be validated through testing, inspection, or measurement
- [ ] **Necessary**: Linked to a business need or higher-level requirement
- [ ] **Feasible**: Achievable within project constraints (time, budget, technology)
- [ ] **Complete**: Includes all necessary conditions and context
- [ ] **Consistent**: Does not contradict other requirements
- [ ] **Prioritized**: Has clear priority for implementation

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**🚫 Avoid These Common Mistakes (Apply to All Requirement Types):**

1. **Using Vague Language**
   - ❌ "The system should handle large amounts of data"
   - ❌ "Users need better portfolio analysis"
   - ✅ "The system must process portfolios containing up to 10,000 assets"
   - ✅ "Portfolio managers need cross-sectional factor exposure analysis"

2. **Non-Verifiable Requirements**
   - ❌ "The system must be user-friendly"
   - ❌ "Improve risk management capabilities"
   - ✅ "The system must display error messages that include specific corrective actions"
   - ✅ "Reduce time to identify concentration risks by 30%"

3. **Missing Context or Constraints**
   - ❌ "Calculate risk metrics"
   - ❌ "As a user, I want to analyze portfolios"
   - ✅ "Calculate risk metrics (VaR, CVaR, volatility) for portfolios with at least 2 assets"
   - ✅ "As a portfolio manager, I want to analyze factor exposures across multiple portfolios"

4. **Mixing Different Requirement Types**
   - ❌ "The system must calculate portfolio risk within 100ms" (mixes functional + performance)
   - ✅ Functional: "The system must calculate portfolio risk metrics"
   - ✅ Non-Functional: "Portfolio risk calculations must complete within 100ms"

5. **Implementation Details Instead of Requirements**
   - ❌ "The system must use pandas DataFrames"
   - ❌ "Implement using mean-variance optimization"
   - ✅ "The system must provide data in a structured, filterable format"
   - ✅ "Enable portfolio optimization with customizable risk-return objectives"

6. **Persona Stereotyping**
   - ❌ "Users are all technical experts who love complex interfaces"
   - ✅ "Primary users have intermediate Python skills and prefer clear, well-documented APIs"

7. **Using Blockquotes in Real Documents**
   - ❌ Authoring personas, problem statements, user stories, or functional requirements using blockquotes (>)
   - ✅ Use blockquotes only in this template to denote templates/examples; in actual requirements documents, use regular headings and body text

### Step-by-Step Writing Process

1. **Start with personas**: Who are we building for?
2. **Identify the business need**: What problem are you solving?
3. **Choose the appropriate requirement type**: Persona → Problem → User Story → Functional Requirements
4. **Use the specific template**: Each requirement type has structured templates
5. **Add necessary context**: Constraints, conditions, and success criteria
6. **Review against quality criteria**: Clear, verifiable, necessary, feasible, complete, consistent
7. **Complete traceability**: Link to related requirements (see traceability guidance)

### Traceability Best Practices

- **Maintain clear relationships**: Each requirement should trace to higher-level needs
- **Update when changes occur**: Keep traceability current as requirements evolve
- **Use consistent IDs**: P-1, PS-1, US-1, FR-1, NFR-1
- **Integrate ID with content**: P-1: [persona name], PS-1: [problem description], US-1: [user story], FR-1: [functional requirement]
- **Maintain hierarchical relationships**: P-1 → PS-1 → US-1 → [FR-1, FR-2] (flexible relationships)
- **Include version numbers if requirements evolve**: FR-1.1, FR-1.2
- **Consider grouping related requirements**: FR-AUTH-1, FR-RISK-1, FR-OPT-1
- **Link dependencies clearly**: FR-2 depends on FR-1, FR-3 depends on FR-1 and FR-2
- **Track status**: Use traceability matrix to monitor progress from persona to implementation

### Key Distinctions

*Common points of confusion when writing requirements:*

#### **Personas vs User Stories vs Functional Requirements**
- **Personas**: Define WHO we're building for (user characteristics, needs, behaviors)
- **User Stories**: Define WHAT users want to accomplish (user goals and business value)
- **Functional Requirements**: Define WHAT the system must do (system capabilities and behavior)

**Traceability**: Personas → User Stories → Functional Requirements

#### **User Stories vs Acceptance Criteria**
- **User Stories**: Specific solutions that address user needs and deliver business value
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Define when individual user stories are functionally complete

**Traceability**: User Stories → Problem Statements, Acceptance Criteria → User Stories

#### **Requirements vs Design vs Process**
- **Requirements** (this document): WHAT the system must do and WHY
- **Design Document** (separate): HOW the system will be implemented
- **Development Process** (separate): HOW work should be conducted (testing, reviews, compatibility policies)

### Level of Detail Guidance
- **Requirements Specification** (this document): Focus on WHAT and WHY
  - User characteristics and needs
  - Business problems and user value
  - System capabilities and completion criteria
  - Quality attributes and constraints

- **Design Document** (separate): Focus on HOW
  - Detailed API signatures
  - Implementation algorithms
  - Data structures and schemas
  - Performance optimizations

### Collaboration Process
1. **Human** creates personas (identifies key user archetypes and characteristics)
2. **Human** creates problem statements (identifies core challenges and pain points)
3. **Human + AI** collaborate to define user stories that will solve the problems and deliver business value
4. **Human + AI** translate user stories into functional requirements using the provided templates and quality criteria
5. **AI** can suggest technical constraints and non-functional requirements
6. **Human + AI** complete traceability sections for each item to ensure alignment across all requirement levels
7. **Human** approves final requirements specification
8. **Human + AI** collaborate on detailed design document
9. **AI** implements with human review and iteration

### Traceability Management
- **Distributed Approach**: Traceability information is maintained in each item's individual "Traceability" section, not in a separate matrix
- **Forward Traceability**: Persona → Problem Statement → User Story → Functional Requirements → Implementation
- **Backward Traceability**: Implementation → Functional Requirements → User Story → Problem Statement → Persona
- **Impact Analysis**: When requirements change, use the individual traceability sections to identify all affected items
- **Validation**: Use the Traceability Validation Checklist to ensure completeness and accuracy
- **Maintenance**: Update traceability information when items are added, modified, or removed
- **Summary View**: The Quick Reference Matrix provides an overview but is not the source of truth

### Maintenance
- Update status as requirement progresses through lifecycle
- Link to related ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Reference implementation PRs and commits
- Update with lessons learned during implementation
