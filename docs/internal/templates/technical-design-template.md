## Executive Summary

[2-3 sentence summary of the technical approach for this specific increment and key design decisions]

## Design Context

This document defines HOW this specific increment will be implemented to fulfill the requirements and architectural decisions established in the [Requirements Document], [System Architecture], and [Feature Decomposition]. It provides the technical blueprint for implementing this increment, including detailed API designs, implementation strategies, and technical decisions needed before development begins.

**Important**: This technical design document focuses on a single increment from the feature decomposition. It does not address system-wide architecture decisions (covered in the System Architecture document) or feature-level planning (covered in the Feature Decomposition document). This document is specifically for design-level decisions needed before development begins.

**Design Principles**: This design must follow the [Design Principles & Standards](../design-principles-and-standards.md). When making design decisions, document principle applications and exceptions in context where relevant. Focus on explaining the reasoning behind design decisions rather than creating separate compliance sections.

**Flow 1: [Flow Name]**
- **Overview**: [What this flow accomplishes within this increment]
- **Components**: [List of components involved in this increment - the "cast of characters"]
- **Behavior**: [Choose the format that best describes how this increment's components interact and data flows]

> **Option 1 - Narrative Format** (best for straightforward, linear flows):
> [Step-by-step narrative combining interactions and data flow, like:]
> - Call download transactions API
> - Download API loops over list of accounts and calls download transactions method on each account object
> - Account object makes API call to brokerage and downloads transactions
> - Account object stores new transactions in database
>
> **Option 2 - Interaction + Data Flow Format** (best for complex systems with distinct interaction and data flow concerns):
> **Interactions:**
> - [Component A] calls [method] on [Component B]
> - [Component B] triggers [event] to [Component C]
> 
> **Data Flow:**
> - [Data source] → [Processing step] → [Output/Storage]
> - [Data transformation] → [Next processing step]
>
> **Option 3 - Sequence Format** (best for complex multi-step processes):
> 1. [Initial action/trigger]
> 2. [Component interaction and data flow]
> 3. [Next component interaction and data flow]
> 4. [Final outcome/storage]

## Template Usage Guidelines

### When to Use This Template
- For designing the technical implementation of a specific increment from feature decomposition
- For significant modifications to existing functionality within an increment scope
- For implementations that impact multiple modules within an increment
- When technical design decisions need to be documented and reviewed before development

- Technical decisions and their rationale for this increment
- Design validation concerns and validation approaches for this increment
- Testing guidance for critical functionality and edge cases for this increment

### Collaboration Process
1. **Technical Lead** creates initial increment design document using this template

3. **Architect** reviews architecture decisions and integration approach
4. **Security Team** reviews security and risk assessments (if applicable)
5. **Product Owner** reviews technical design completeness and readiness for implementation
6. **Technical Lead** incorporates feedback and finalizes increment design
7. **Team** uses increment design document to guide implementation

### Document Maintenance
- **Design Changes**: Update increment design document when significant implementation discoveries require design changes
- **Approval Process**: Follow the [Decision-Making & Conflict Resolution](../process/development-process.md#decision-making--conflict-resolution) process when design changes affect previously approved documents
