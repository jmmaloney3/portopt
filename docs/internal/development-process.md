## Overview

This document defines the development process, standards, and quality gates that apply to all software development work within the portopt project. These standards ensure consistent quality, maintainability, and reliability across all features and enhancements. All development work must follow these standards regardless of the specific requirement being implemented.

## Definition of Done

The Definition of Done defines the criteria that must be met for any user story or development task to be considered complete. These criteria apply to ALL development work and must be satisfied before code can be merged or released.

### Process Requirements

All development work must satisfy these process requirements:

- [ ] **Functionality implemented and tested** - Core functionality works as specified
- [ ] **Unit tests with >90% coverage** - Comprehensive unit test coverage for new code
- [ ] **Integration tests pass** - All existing and new integration tests pass
- [ ] **Code review completed** - At least one peer review with approval
- [ ] **API documentation updated** - Public APIs have complete docstrings and examples
- [ ] **Examples/demos created** - Usage examples provided for new functionality
- [ ] **Backward compatibility maintained** - Existing functionality continues to work (if applicable)

### Quality Gates

All development work must pass these quality gates:

- [ ] **Follows [portopt Design Principles](design-principles.md)** - Adheres to established architectural patterns
- [ ] **No regression in existing functionality** - All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] **Performance benchmarks met** - New code meets performance requirements (if applicable)
- [ ] **Security review completed** - Security implications reviewed and addressed (if applicable)
- [ ] **Code quality standards met** - Follows PEP 8, passes linting, maintains consistency
- [ ] **Testing coverage requirements met** - Achieves required test coverage thresholds
- [ ] **Documentation standards followed** - Internal documentation is complete and up-to-date
- [ ] **Monitoring and logging implemented** - Appropriate logging and monitoring are in place

## Development Workflow

### 1. Planning Phase
- Requirements are clearly defined and approved
- Technical design is reviewed and approved
- Dependencies and risks are identified
- Work is estimated and prioritized

### 2. Development Phase
- Feature branches are created from main
- Code is developed following established patterns
- Unit tests are written alongside implementation
- Documentation is updated as work progresses

### 3. Review Phase
- Code review is conducted by peers
- All automated tests pass
- Manual testing is performed
- Documentation is reviewed

### 4. Integration Phase
- Code is merged to main branch
- Integration tests are run
- Deployment validation is performed
- Release notes are updated

## Code Quality Standards

### Python Code Standards
- **Style Guide**: Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- **Line Length**: Keep lines under 100 characters when practical
- **Naming**: Use meaningful variable and function names
- **Type Hints**: Add type hints for public APIs and complex functions
- **Docstrings**: Include docstrings for all public classes and methods

### Documentation Standards
- **API Documentation**: All public APIs must have complete docstrings
- **Usage Examples**: Complex functionality must include usage examples
- **Code Comments**: Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- **README Updates**: Update project README for significant changes

### Testing Standards
- **Unit Tests**: >90% coverage for new code
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between modules
- **Test Naming**: Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- **Edge Cases**: Include tests for error conditions and edge cases

## Repository Standards

### Branch Management
- **Main Branch**: Always deployable, protected from direct pushes
- **Feature Branches**: Created for each user story or task
- **Branch Naming**: Use descriptive names (e.g., `feature/risk-calculation`, `bugfix/portfolio-loading`)

### Commit Standards
- **Commit Messages**: Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent a single logical change
- **Commit Frequency**: Commit often with meaningful checkpoints

### Pull Request Standards
- **PR Description**: Include context, changes made, and testing performed
- **Review Requirements**: At least one approving review required
- **CI/CD Checks**: All automated checks must pass
- **Documentation**: Include any necessary documentation updates

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Framework**: Use pytest for Python testing
- **Coverage**: Maintain >90% test coverage for new code
- **Test Structure**: Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- **Mocking**: Use appropriate mocking for external dependencies

### Integration Testing
- **Scope**: Test module interactions and end-to-end workflows
- **Data**: Use representative test data sets
- **Environment**: Test in isolated, reproducible environments

### Performance Testing
- **Benchmarks**: Establish performance baselines for critical functions
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure new changes don't degrade performance
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor memory and CPU usage patterns

## Release Process

### Version Management
- **Semantic Versioning**: Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- **Release Notes**: Document all changes, fixes, and new features
- **Changelog**: Maintain detailed changelog for all releases

### Deployment
- **Staging**: Test in staging environment before production
- **Rollback Plan**: Have rollback procedures for all deployments
- **Monitoring**: Monitor system health after deployments

## API Compatibility Policy

### Backwards Compatibility Standards

All changes to public APIs must follow these compatibility standards:

#### **Semantic Versioning**
- **MAJOR version**: Breaking changes that require user code modifications
- **MINOR version**: New functionality that is backwards compatible
- **PATCH version**: Backwards compatible bug fixes

#### **Breaking Change Definition**
Breaking changes include but are not limited to:
- Removing public functions, classes, or methods
- Changing function signatures (parameters, return types)
- Changing public class interfaces
- Modifying expected behavior of existing functionality
- Changing import paths or module organization

#### **Non-Breaking Changes**
These changes are allowed in MINOR releases:
- Adding new public functions, classes, or methods
- Adding new optional parameters with default values
- Adding new return fields to existing functions (where applicable)
- Internal implementation improvements that don't affect public behavior

#### **Deprecation Process**
- **Warning Phase**: Mark as deprecated with clear warnings and migration guidance
- **Timeline**: Minimum 6 months deprecation period before removal
- **Documentation**: Update all documentation to reflect deprecation
- **Migration Guide**: Provide clear migration path to new functionality

#### **API Stability Guarantees**
- **Public API**: Covered by backwards compatibility guarantees
- **Private/Internal**: Marked with leading underscore, no compatibility guarantees
- **Experimental**: Clearly marked, may change without notice

### API Documentation Requirements
- All public APIs must have complete docstrings
- Breaking changes must be documented in changelog with migration instructions
- Deprecations must include timeline and recommended alternatives
