## Executive Summary

[2-3 sentence summary of what this requirement addresses and why it matters]

## Requirements Overview

This document organizes requirements into five interconnected types that work together to ensure complete coverage from business need to system requirements:

### **Business Requirements** → **WHY**
Define the fundamental problems, strategic goals, and user value that justify this development effort.
- **Problem Statements**: Core challenges and pain points that need solving
- **Objectives & Key Results**: Strategic goals with measurable success criteria  
- **User Stories**: Specific user-centered solutions that deliver business value

### **Functional Requirements** → **WHAT**
Define the core capabilities and behaviors the system must provide, independent of how users access them.
- System capabilities, business logic, data processing, and computational features
- Focus on what the system does, not how developers interact with it

### **Developer Experience (DX) Requirements** → **HOW** 
Define how developers discover, access, and successfully use the functional capabilities.
- API design, module organization, error handling, documentation, and usability
- Critical for libraries where developers are the primary users

### **Non-Functional Requirements** → **HOW WELL**
Define quality attributes and performance characteristics the system must exhibit.
- Performance, reliability, security requirements that apply to system behavior
- Measurable quality standards independent of specific functionality

### **Technical Constraints** → **WITHIN WHAT LIMITS**
Define environmental limitations and compatibility requirements the system must operate within.
- Platform support, dependency constraints, compatibility requirements
- External factors that constrain implementation choices

### **Requirements Flow**
**Business Foundation:**
- **Problem Statements** → Identify core challenges
- **Objectives & Key Results** → Define strategic goals  
- **User Stories** → Translate into user-centered solutions

**System Requirements:**
- **Functional Requirements** → Define system capabilities (WHAT)
- **DX Requirements** → Define developer interaction (HOW)
- **Non-Functional Requirements** → Define quality attributes (HOW WELL)

**Constraints:** All technical requirements operate within **Technical Constraints** (platform, compatibility, dependencies)

*Note: For developer-facing libraries, Functional and DX requirements work as pairs - Functional defines system capabilities while DX defines how developers access those capabilities. Both trace back to the same User Stories but address different aspects of the solution.*

## Business Requirements
*Business requirements capture the WHY behind any development effort - the fundamental problems that need solving, the strategic goals to achieve, and the user value to deliver. This section establishes the business justification and user-centered foundation for all technical work that follows. Business requirements consist of three interconnected components: Problem Statements identify the core challenges, Objectives & Key Results define strategic goals with measurable outcomes, and User Stories translate business needs into specific user-centered solutions. Unlike functional or technical requirements that focus on system capabilities, business requirements focus on human needs, business value, and measurable impact. Every technical requirement should trace back to these business requirements to ensure development efforts remain aligned with actual user problems and organizational goals.*

### Problem Statements
*Problem statements define the core challenges and pain points that drive the need for new functionality. They serve as the foundation for all subsequent requirements by clearly articulating who is affected, what they're trying to accomplish, and why current solutions are inadequate. Well-written problem statements ensure that objectives, user stories, and technical requirements all trace back to real user needs and business value. For developer-facing libraries like portopt, problem statements should focus on developer workflow challenges, API limitations, or gaps in functionality that prevent users from achieving their goals efficiently.*

## Developer Experience (DX) Requirements

*For developer-facing libraries like portopt, developer experience IS the product experience. This section defines how developers will discover, access, and successfully use the functional capabilities. Unlike traditional products where UX is separate from functional requirements, library DX requirements are core product requirements that directly impact adoption and user satisfaction.*

### Expected Module Integration
*Module organization directly impacts developer experience by determining where developers find functionality, how they import it, and whether it follows expected patterns.*

- **Primary Module**: [Which existing module will house the main functionality]
- **Supporting Modules**: [Modules that will be modified or extended]
- **New Modules**: [Any new modules that may be needed]

**Example:**
*For a requirement like "Add support for custom factor models":*

> - **Primary Module**: `portopt.factor` - Will house the new factor model interface and base classes
> - **Supporting Modules**: 
>   - `portopt.portfolio` - Modified to accept custom factor models in analysis methods
>   - `portopt.metrics` - Extended to calculate metrics using custom factor exposures
>   - `portopt.config` - Updated to support custom factor model configuration
> - **New Modules**: None - functionality fits within existing module structure

**Purpose:**
- Assess implementation scope and complexity early
- Ensure new functionality follows logical code organization
- Identify potential integration challenges with existing modules
- Plan for API consistency and backward compatibility

### API Design Considerations
*Define how this functionality integrates with existing APIs and what design constraints or exceptions apply.*

*This implementation must follow the [portopt Design Principles](../design-principles.md). Document any requirement-specific design constraints that will impact how developers interact with the functionality.*

**API Design Consideration Template:**

> - **[Descriptive Title]**: [Brief description of the API design constraint or consideration]
>   - **Type**: [Consistency | Exception | Integration | Usability | Backward Compatibility]
>   - **Rationale**: [Why this consideration is necessary for good DX]
>   - **Impact**: [How this affects API design and developer workflows]
>   - **Validation**: [How API design quality will be verified]

**Examples:**

> - **Parameter Naming Consistency**: New optimization methods must follow existing parameter naming conventions
>   - **Type**: Consistency
>   - **Rationale**: Developers expect consistent parameter names across similar functions
>   - **Impact**: Method signatures must use 'weights' not 'allocations', 'returns' not 'performance'
>   - **Validation**: API review confirms naming matches existing optimization methods
> 
> - **Fluent Interface Exception**: Risk calculation may return objects that support method chaining
>   - **Type**: Exception
>   - **Rationale**: Risk analysis workflows naturally involve multiple related calculations
>   - **Impact**: Return objects with methods that return self to enable chaining
>   - **Validation**: Documentation examples demonstrate natural workflow patterns

### Error Handling & Developer Messaging
*Define how the system communicates problems and guides developers toward solutions.*

**Error Handling Requirements:**
- **Error Message Clarity**: [Requirements for clear, actionable error messages]
- **Exception Types**: [What specific exception types should be used]
- **Recovery Guidance**: [How errors should guide developers toward solutions]
- **Validation Feedback**: [How input validation errors are communicated]

**Example:**

> - Portfolio weight validation must provide specific correction guidance
> - Custom factor model errors must suggest valid alternative configurations  
> - Performance warnings must include optimization recommendations

### Documentation Requirements
*Define what documentation is needed for successful developer adoption.*

**Required Documentation:**
- **API Reference**: [Scope and detail of API documentation needed]
- **Usage Examples**: [Types and complexity of examples required]
- **Migration Guides**: [Documentation for changes affecting existing users]
- **Troubleshooting**: [Common problems and solutions to document]

**Example:**

> - Complete docstrings with parameter types and example usage
> - Jupyter notebook demonstrating end-to-end factor analysis workflow  
> - Migration guide for users of deprecated risk calculation methods
> - FAQ covering common portfolio data formatting issues

### Learning Curve & Usability
*Define developer onboarding and complexity expectations.*

**Usability Requirements:**
- **Discoverability**: [How developers will find this functionality]
- **Learning Curve**: [Complexity expectations and learning path]
- **Integration Effort**: [How easily this integrates with developer workflows]
- **Cognitive Load**: [Mental complexity of using this functionality]

**Example:**

> - New users should be able to run basic factor analysis within 5 minutes of reading documentation
> - Advanced features should be discoverable through progressive disclosure in documentation  
> - Integration with existing Portfolio objects should require no additional imports
> - Method names should be self-documenting for common use cases

## Non-Functional Requirements
*These specify quality attributes that the implemented system must meet. Unlike Definition of Done (which defines process and quality gates for story completion), these define measurable characteristics of the system itself.*

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: [Acceptable execution time for typical use cases]
- **Throughput**: [Number of operations per second/minute/hour]
- **Memory Usage**: [Memory constraints or expectations]
- **Scalability**: [How should it scale with data size/portfolio count]

**Examples:**

> - Portfolio volatility calculation must complete within 100ms for portfolios containing up to 500 assets
> - CSV file format validation must display errors within 5 seconds of upload  
> - Factor exposure calculations must process 100 portfolios within 30 seconds

### Reliability Requirements
- **Availability**: [System uptime expectations]
- **Error Recovery**: [How should errors be handled and recovered from]
- **Data Validation**: [Input validation and data integrity requirements]
- **Edge Cases**: [Known edge cases to handle gracefully]

### Security Requirements
- **Data Protection**: [How sensitive data should be handled]
- **Input Validation**: [Security-related input validation requirements]
- **Access Control**: [Any access control requirements]

## Technical Constraints

*Technical constraints define limitations or requirements that the system must operate within. These should be expressed as constraints on system behavior or capabilities, not as design decisions about how to implement the system.*

### Platform Requirements
- **Operating System Support**: [Which operating systems the system must support]
- **Python Version Compatibility**: [Minimum and maximum Python versions required]
- **Hardware Requirements**: [Minimum hardware specifications needed]

### Dependency Constraints  
- **Required Compatibility**: [External systems or libraries this feature must be compatible with]
- **Prohibited Dependencies**: [Dependencies that cannot be used due to licensing, security, or policy constraints]
- **Version Constraints**: [Specific version requirements for critical dependencies]

**Examples:**
> - Must be compatible with Python 3.8+ through Python 3.12
> - Must run on Windows 10+, macOS 12+, and Ubuntu 20.04+
> - Must work with NumPy 1.20+ and Pandas 1.3+
> - Cannot introduce GPL-licensed dependencies
> - Must integrate with existing Jupyter notebook environments

**Note on API Backwards Compatibility:**
*API backwards compatibility is governed by the project-wide [API Compatibility Policy](../development-process.md#api-compatibility-policy). Individual requirements should only specify compatibility constraints when they differ from or add to the standard policy.*

## Traceability Summary

### Quick Reference Matrix
*This matrix provides a high-level overview of traceability relationships. Detailed traceability information is maintained in each individual item's "Traceability" section.*

*Note: For developer-facing libraries, user stories typically generate multiple types of requirements. Functional Requirements define system capabilities while DX Requirements define how developers interact with those capabilities. The relationships between FR and DX requirements are flexible - not every FR needs a DX requirement, and some DX requirements span multiple FRs.*

| Problem Statement | Objective | User Story | Requirements Generated | Status |
|-------------------|-----------|------------|----------------------|---------|
| PS-1 | OBJ-1 | US-1 | FR-1, DX-1, DX-2 | [Not Started/In Progress/Complete] |
| PS-1 | OBJ-1 | US-2 | FR-2, FR-3 | [Not Started/In Progress/Complete] |
| PS-2 | OBJ-2 | US-3 | FR-4, DX-3, DX-4, DX-5 | [Not Started/In Progress/Complete] |

*Example interpretations:*
- *US-1 generates one functional capability (FR-1) with multiple DX aspects (API design DX-1, error handling DX-2)*
- *US-2 generates internal functionality (FR-2, FR-3) with no direct developer-facing aspects*
- *US-3 generates one functional capability (FR-4) with comprehensive DX requirements (module integration DX-3, documentation DX-4, usability DX-5)*

## Requirements Writing Guidance

### Universal Quality Criteria

Every requirement (Problem Statement, Objective, User Story, Functional Requirement) should be:
- [ ] **Clear & Unambiguous**: Uses precise language that cannot be misinterpreted
- [ ] **Verifiable**: Can be validated through testing, inspection, or measurement
- [ ] **Necessary**: Linked to a business need or higher-level requirement
- [ ] **Feasible**: Achievable within project constraints (time, budget, technology)
- [ ] **Complete**: Includes all necessary conditions and context
- [ ] **Consistent**: Does not contradict other requirements
- [ ] **Prioritized**: Has clear priority for implementation

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**🚫 Avoid These Common Mistakes (Apply to All Requirement Types):**

1. **Using Vague Language**
   - ❌ "The system should handle large amounts of data"
   - ❌ "Users need better portfolio analysis"
   - ✅ "The system must process portfolios containing up to 10,000 assets"
   - ✅ "Portfolio managers need cross-sectional factor exposure analysis"

2. **Non-Verifiable Requirements**
   - ❌ "The system must be user-friendly"
   - ❌ "Improve risk management capabilities"
   - ✅ "The system must display error messages that include specific corrective actions"
   - ✅ "Reduce time to identify concentration risks by 30%"

3. **Missing Context or Constraints**
   - ❌ "Calculate risk metrics"
   - ❌ "As a user, I want to analyze portfolios"
   - ✅ "Calculate risk metrics (VaR, CVaR, volatility) for portfolios with at least 2 assets"
   - ✅ "As a portfolio manager, I want to analyze factor exposures across multiple portfolios"

4. **Mixing Different Requirement Types**
   - ❌ "The system must calculate portfolio risk within 100ms" (mixes functional + performance)
   - ✅ Functional: "The system must calculate portfolio risk metrics"
   - ✅ Non-Functional: "Portfolio risk calculations must complete within 100ms"

5. **Implementation Details Instead of Requirements**
   - ❌ "The system must use pandas DataFrames"
   - ❌ "Implement using mean-variance optimization"
   - ✅ "The system must provide data in a structured, filterable format"
   - ✅ "Enable portfolio optimization with customizable risk-return objectives"

### Step-by-Step Writing Process

1. **Start with the business need**: What problem are you solving?
2. **Choose the appropriate requirement type**: Problem → Objective → User Story → Functional Requirement
3. **Use the specific template**: Each requirement type has structured templates
4. **Add necessary context**: Constraints, conditions, and success criteria
5. **Review against quality criteria**: Clear, verifiable, necessary, feasible, complete, consistent
6. **Complete traceability**: Link to related requirements (see traceability guidance)

### Traceability Best Practices

- **Maintain clear relationships**: Each requirement should trace to higher-level needs
- **Update when changes occur**: Keep traceability current as requirements evolve
- **Use consistent IDs**: PS-1, OBJ-1, US-1, FR-1 for easy cross-referencing
- **Validate completeness**: Use the Traceability Validation Checklist (see summary section)

## Template Usage Guidelines

### When to Use This Template
- For new major features or capabilities

- **Business Requirements**: WHY (problems, user needs, business value)
- **Functional Requirements**: WHAT (system capabilities and behavior)
- **Developer Experience (DX) Requirements**: HOW (developers discover, access, and use capabilities)
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: HOW WELL (quality attributes, constraints)

### ID Schemes and Traceability
- **Use consistent prefixes**: PS-1, OBJ-1, KR-1.1, US-1, FR-1, DX-1, NFR-1
- **Integrate ID with content**: PS-1: [problem description], OBJ-1: [objective statement], US-1: [user story], FR-1: [functional requirement], DX-1: [DX requirement]
- **Maintain hierarchical relationships**: PS-1 → OBJ-1 → US-1 → [FR-1, FR-2] + [DX-1, DX-2, DX-3] (flexible relationships)
- **Include version numbers if requirements evolve**: FR-1.1, FR-1.2
- **Consider grouping related requirements**: FR-AUTH-1, FR-RISK-1, FR-OPT-1
- **Link dependencies clearly**: FR-2 depends on FR-1, FR-3 depends on FR-1 and FR-2
- **Track status**: Use traceability matrix to monitor progress from problem to implementation

### Key Distinctions

*Common points of confusion when writing requirements:*

#### **Objectives vs User Stories vs Acceptance Criteria**
- **Objectives**: Strategic goals measured by Key Results across multiple user stories
- **User Stories**: Specific solutions that support the overall objective (not individual Key Results)
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Define when individual user stories are functionally complete

**Traceability**: User Stories → Objective (measured by Key Results), not User Stories → Key Results

#### **Functional vs DX Requirements Relationships**
For developer-facing libraries, these work as flexible pairs:
- **Not all Functional Requirements need DX Requirements** (internal processing, validation)
- **Not all DX Requirements map to specific Functional Requirements** (API consistency, overall usability)
- **One User Story often generates multiple requirements** (Functional + DX + Non-Functional)

#### **Requirements vs Design vs Process**
- **Requirements** (this document): WHAT the system must do and WHY
- **Design Document** (separate): HOW the system will be implemented  
- **Development Process** (separate): HOW work should be conducted (testing, reviews, compatibility policies)

### Level of Detail Guidance
- **Requirements Specification** (this document): Focus on WHAT and WHY
  - Business problems and user value
  - System capabilities and completion criteria
  - Quality attributes and constraints
  
- **Design Document** (separate): Focus on HOW
  - Detailed API signatures
  - Implementation algorithms
  - Data structures and schemas
  - Performance optimizations

### Collaboration Process
1. **Human** creates problem statements (identifies core challenges and pain points)
2. **Human + AI** collaborate to define objectives and key results (strategic goals and success metrics)
3. **Human + AI** develop user stories that will achieve the OKRs and solve the problems
4. **Human + AI** translate user stories into functional requirements using the provided templates and quality criteria
5. **Technical PM/DX Engineer + AI** define developer experience requirements (API design, error handling, documentation, usability)
6. **AI** can suggest technical constraints and non-functional requirements
7. **Human + AI** complete traceability sections for each item to ensure alignment across all requirement levels
8. **Human** approves final requirements specification
9. **Human + AI** collaborate on detailed design document
10. **AI** implements with human review and iteration

### Traceability Management
- **Distributed Approach**: Traceability information is maintained in each item's individual "Traceability" section, not in a separate matrix
- **Forward Traceability**: Problem Statement → Objective → User Story → Functional Requirement → Implementation
- **Backward Traceability**: Implementation → Functional Requirement → User Story → Objective → Problem Statement
- **Impact Analysis**: When requirements change, use the individual traceability sections to identify all affected items
- **Validation**: Use the Traceability Validation Checklist to ensure completeness and accuracy
- **Maintenance**: Update traceability information when items are added, modified, or removed
- **Summary View**: The Quick Reference Matrix provides an overview but is not the source of truth

### Maintenance
- Update status as requirement progresses through lifecycle
- Link to related ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Reference implementation PRs and commits
- Update with lessons learned during implementation
