## Executive Summary

This requirement addresses the critical "flying blind" problem where portfolio managers lack objective performance metrics to evaluate investment decisions. The system will provide comprehensive performance analysis including time-weighted and money-weighted returns, factor attribution, risk metrics, and comparison capabilities against alternative investment strategies.

## Requirements Overview

This document organizes requirements into four interconnected types that work together to ensure complete coverage from business need to system requirements:

### **Personas** → **WHO**
Define the key user archetypes and their characteristics that drive design decisions and user experience requirements.
- **Primary Personas**: Main user types whose needs must be satisfied for success
- **Secondary Personas**: Supporting user types with specific needs or constraints
- **Anti-Personas**: User types explicitly not targeted or supported

### **Business Requirements** → **WHY**
Define the fundamental problems and user value that justify this development effort.
- **Problem Statements**: Core challenges and pain points that need solving
- **User Stories**: Specific user-centered solutions that deliver business value

### **Functional Requirements** → **WHAT**
Define the core capabilities and behaviors the system must provide, independent of how users access them.
- System capabilities, business logic, data processing, and computational features
- Focus on what the system does, not how developers interact with it

### **Non-Functional Requirements** → **HOW WELL**
Define quality attributes and performance characteristics the system must exhibit.
- Performance, reliability, security requirements that apply to system behavior
- Measurable quality standards independent of specific functionality

### **Technical Constraints** → **WITHIN WHAT LIMITS**
Define environmental limitations and compatibility requirements the system must operate within.
- Platform support, dependency constraints, compatibility requirements
- External factors that constrain implementation choices

### **Requirements Flow**
**User Foundation:**
- **Personas** → Define who we're building for

**Business Foundation:**
- **Problem Statements** → Identify core challenges
- **User Stories** → Translate into user-centered solutions

**System Requirements:**
- **Functional Requirements** → Define system capabilities (WHAT)
- **Non-Functional Requirements** → Define quality attributes (HOW WELL)

**Constraints:** All technical requirements operate within **Technical Constraints** (platform, compatibility, dependencies)

*Note: For developer-facing libraries, Functional requirements define the system capabilities that developers will use. For end-user facing applications, Functional requirements define the system capabilities that support user interactions. All trace back to the same User Stories and address the core system capabilities needed to deliver value.*

## Personas

*Personas are detailed, semi-fictional representations of key user archetypes that help ensure requirements remain user-centered and realistic. They provide context for understanding user needs, behaviors, goals, and constraints. Well-defined personas help validate that business requirements, user stories, and technical requirements all address real user needs and create meaningful value. For developer-facing libraries, personas should focus on different types of developers, analysts, and technical users.*

- **Sensitive Information**: No special encryption requirements for local development use case

## Technical Constraints

*Technical constraints define limitations or requirements that the system must operate within.*

### Platform Requirements

**Operating System Support**: Must support macOS development environment
- **Primary Platform**: macOS (MacBook Air development environment)
- **Python Version**: Python 3.12.7 or later
- **Development Tools**: Must work seamlessly in Cursor IDE with Jupyter notebooks

**Package Management**: Must integrate with existing dependency management
- **Package Manager**: pipenv for dependency management
- **Testing Framework**: pytest for automated testing
- **Documentation**: Jupyter notebook examples and comprehensive docstrings

### Dependency Constraints

**Required Compatibility**: Must work with existing portopt dependencies
- **Core Dependencies**: pandas, numpy, cvxpy, statsmodel, duckdb, ibis-framework, pyyaml (maintain existing version compatibility)
- **Financial Libraries**: bt, ffn frameworks for backtesting and performance analysis (bt already in use)
- **Market Data**: Continue using yfinance for price data (consistent with existing market_data.py)

**New Dependencies**: New dependencies should be added judiciously
- **Approval Process**: New dependencies require explicit approval
- **Justification**: Each new dependency must provide significant value that cannot be achieved with existing tools
- **Lightweight Preference**: Prefer lightweight, well-maintained packages with minimal sub-dependencies

**Version Constraints**: Maintain compatibility with existing portopt ecosystem
- **Backward Compatibility**: Performance analysis should not break existing portopt functionality
- **API Evolution**: Lax backward compatibility acceptable for performance analysis APIs (early development phase)
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure performance module works with existing portfolio optimization and analysis workflows

## Traceability Summary

### Quick Reference Matrix
*This matrix provides a high-level overview of traceability relationships. Detailed traceability information is maintained in each individual item's "Traceability" section.*

*Note: For developer-facing libraries, user stories typically generate functional requirements that define system capabilities. The relationships between requirements are flexible - not every user story needs multiple functional requirements, and some functional requirements may span multiple user stories.*

| Problem Statement | Objective | User Story | Requirements Generated | Status |
|-------------------|-----------|------------|----------------------|---------|
| PS-1 | OBJ-1 | US-1 | FR-1, FR-2, FR-8 | Not Started |
| PS-1 | OBJ-1 | US-2 | FR-3, FR-2 | Not Started |
| PS-1 | OBJ-1 | US-3 | FR-4 | Not Started |
| PS-2 | OBJ-2 | US-4 | FR-5, FR-6 | Not Started |
| PS-2 | OBJ-2 | US-5 | FR-7, FR-5 | Not Started |
| PS-3 | OBJ-3 | US-6 | FR-10, FR-9 | Not Started |
| PS-3 | OBJ-3 | US-7 | FR-9, FR-10 | Not Started |

| [To be defined] | PS-1 | US-8 | FR-1, FR-4, FR-5, FR-11 | Not Started |

*Example interpretations:*
- *US-1 generates multiple functional capabilities (FR-1, FR-2, FR-8) for portfolio performance analysis*
- *US-2 generates internal functionality (FR-3, FR-2) for money-weighted return calculations*
- *US-3 generates functional capabilities (FR-4) for risk metrics calculation*

### Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 - Core Performance Analysis (Must Have)**
- FR-1: TWR calculation engine
- FR-2: Time period handling
- FR-4: Basic risk metrics
- FR-8: Transaction data integration

**Phase 2 - Factor Attribution (Must Have)**
- FR-5: Factor attribution analysis
- FR-6: Factor weight handling integration
- FR-10: Basic benchmark comparison

**Phase 3 - Advanced Analysis (Should Have)**
- FR-3: MWR calculation engine
- FR-7: Factor concentration analysis
- FR-9: Alternative portfolio calculation

## Dependencies and Assumptions

### Prerequisites
- Existing portopt library with metrics.py, holdings.py, and factor weight capabilities
- Transaction data available in CSV format from supported brokerages
- Historical price data accessible via Yahoo Finance API

### Assumptions
- Factor weights remain static over time for initial release (dynamic factor weights deferred)
- Transaction volume remains modest (<100 transactions per year) for performance requirements
- Users have basic financial knowledge of performance metrics and attribution concepts
- bt/ffn framework integration provides sufficient backtesting capabilities

### Related Requirements
- Future requirement for dynamic factor weight handling over time
- Future requirement for database storage of transactions and performance calculations
- Future requirement for more sophisticated factor analysis (factor loadings vs percentage allocations)

### Traceability Validation Checklist
*Use this checklist to ensure traceability is complete and accurate:*

- [ ] **Persona Foundation**: Every primary persona has at least one problem statement that directly affects them
- [ ] **Persona Coverage**: Every problem statement is linked to at least one primary persona
- [ ] **Forward Traceability**: Every problem statement leads to at least one user story
- [ ] **Forward Traceability**: Every user story is implemented by at least one functional requirement
- [ ] **Backward Traceability**: Every functional requirement traces back to a user story
- [ ] **Backward Traceability**: Every user story addresses a defined problem
- [ ] **Backward Traceability**: Every problem statement affects at least one defined persona
- [ ] **No Orphans**: No requirements exist without clear business justification
- [ ] **No Gaps**: All problem statements have corresponding implementation paths
- [ ] **Dependencies Clear**: All requirement dependencies are documented
- [ ] **Impact Analysis**: Each requirement's impacts on other requirements are identified
- [ ] **Persona Validation**: All personas have clear, realistic characteristics and traceable needs
- [ ] **Anti-Persona Clarity**: Anti-personas clearly define scope boundaries and design constraints
